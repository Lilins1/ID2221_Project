All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at histopathologic examination.,In 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen examinations."

Three hundred eighty-one surgeons responded to this survey and 351 were used for the analysis (response rate of 38%).,Answers showed a large variety in clinical practices among breast surgeons across the country.

Decisions to reexcise specific margins varied greatly. For example, 57% of surgeons would never reexcise for a positive deep margin, but 53% would always reexcise for a positive anterior margin. Most importantly, there was a large range in answers about acceptable margins with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Fifteen percent of surgeons would accept any negative margin, 28% would accept a 1-mm negative margin, 50% would accept a 2-mm negative margin, 12% would accept a 5-mm negative margin, and 3% would accept a 10-mm negative margin."

Of 118 volunteers, 32 were excluded because they withdrew for personal reasons or because they did not meet study criteria.,Demographic variables, functional status of the care receiver, use of home care services, and needs assessment to identify additional services.,An average of 75.4% respondents did not use formal support services. Just under half of caregivers were dissatisfied with the attention they received from the health care system, and more than one third expressed feelings of stress, depression, guilt, and isolation."

        "QUESTION": "Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants?",
        "CONTEXTS": [
            "Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC.,To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants.,An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA).,A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows."

        "CONTEXTS": [
            "This paper investigates the impact of geographic scale (census tract, zip code, and county) on the detection of disparities in breast cancer mortality among three ethnic groups in Texas (period 1995-2005). Racial disparities were quantified using both relative (RR) and absolute (RD) statistics that account for the population size and correct for unreliable rates typically observed for minority groups and smaller geographic units. Results were then correlated with socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the poverty level.,African-American and Hispanic women generally experience higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level. The largest proportion of significant results was observed for the RD statistic and census tract data. Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%."

        "CONTEXTS": [
            "This study was designed to determine prospectively whether the systematic use of PET/CT associated with conventional techniques could improve the accuracy of staging in patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. We also assessed the impact on the therapeutic strategy.,Between 2006 and 2008, 97 patients who were evaluated for resection of LMCRC were prospectively enrolled. Preoperative workup included multidetector-CT (MDCT) and PET/CT. In 11 patients with liver steatosis or iodinated contrast allergy, MR also was performed. Sixty-eight patients underwent laparotomy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values for hepatic and extrahepatic staging of MDCT and PET-CT were calculated.,In a lesion-by-lesion analysis of the hepatic staging, the sensitivity of MDCT/RM was superior to PET/CT (89.2 vs. 55%, p < 0.001). On the extrahepatic staging, PET/CT was superior to MDCT/MR only for the detection of locoregional recurrence (p = 0.03) and recurrence in uncommon sites (p = 0.016). New findings in PET/CT resulted in a change in therapeutic strategy in 17 patients. However, additional information was correct only in eight cases and wrong in nine patients."

            "To determine the effect of prior benign prostate biopsies on the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy for prostate cancer.,A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater.,Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P<0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P<0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P<0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group."
