Ovarian dysfunction, hyperandrogenemia (HA), infertility resulting from oligoovulation or anovulation, and menstrual cycle disturbances are recognized as the primary characteristics of PCOS [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref>]. Patients with PCOS exhibit increased cystic follicles, disorganized arrangement of granulosa cells (GCs), thickened thecal cell layer, and impaired conversion of androgens to estrogens, which may contribute to HA. Numerous studies have speculated that HA could be the principal cause of PCOS [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Excessive androgens impair ovarian function and disrupt the follicular microenvironment, ultimately leading to abnormal oxidative stress and formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies have revealed a significant increase in oxidative stress levels in individuals with PCOS [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], further suggesting its association with the pathogenesis of this condition.</p><p>Mitochondria play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and are involved in regulating various cellular functions [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] such as including aerobic phosphorylation, electron transport, calcium homeostasis [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and signal transduction. These functions are essential for the body&#x02019;s physiological activities. Mitochondria serve as the primary sites for cellular energy transformation and biological oxidation, generating most of the cell&#x02019;s energy to sustain life, while also producing ROS [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>]. Under normal physiological conditions, intracellular ROS participate in cell signal transduction and regulate bodily functions. However, excessive ROS accumulation because of mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] can lead to oxidative stress. Increased ROS levels result in the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, and damage to mitochondrial structure and function. Mitophagy is primarily responsible for selectively removing damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Damaged or excess mitochondria are enclosed within autophagosomes and subsequently fused with lysosomes for degradation through regulation of the Pink1-Parkin pathway. When cellular oxidative stress causes mitochondrial damage, mitophagy is activated to remove abnormal mitochondria and prevent them from harming cells. Studies have shown that the level of mitophagy in PCOS patients is higher than that in the normal population [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and appropriately increased mitophagy may alleviate cell damage caused by oxidative stress [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and ameliorate the occurrence and development of PCOS.</p><p>CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 (CISD2), a member of the NEET protein family, encodes nutrient deprivation autophagy factor-1 (NAF-1), which localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It plays a crucial role in regulating aging, cancer, autophagy, neurodegeneration, and apoptosis [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;24</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed that CISD2 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes including the regulation of cellular iron levels, maintenance of ROS homeostasis, and control of mitophagy [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;28</xref>]. CISD2 is a redox-active [2Fe&#x02013;2S] cluster protein involved in these processes. The biochemical properties of the [2Fe&#x02013;2S] cluster are modulated by its redox state [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This unique structure demonstrates its pivotal role in redox regulation and iron regulation. In recent years, numerous studies have showed that <italic toggle="yes">CISD2</italic> is a highly conserved gene widely expressed in various tissues and cells throughout the human body and plays a critical role in diverse pathological and physiological processes, such as maintaining mitochondrial structural integrity, regulating mitochondrial function, controlling mitophagy, as well as modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and redox homeostasis [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, whether it is involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS is still unclear and necessitates further investigation.</p><p>In this study, we observed significantly elevated levels of oxidative stress and mitophagy in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) obtained from patients diagnosed with PCOS, as compared to those from individuals without PCOS. Moreover, increased expression of CISD2 was detected among PCOS patients. By inhibiting the expression of CISD2 in the testosterone-stimulated human ovarian granulosa cell line (KGN), we effectively alleviated oxidative stress by promoting enhanced levels of mitophagy. These findings suggest that <italic toggle="yes">CISD2</italic> may play a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance within the follicular microenvironment during the development of PCOS through its regulation of both oxidative stress and mitophagy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" disp-level="1" id="S002"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S002-S2001"><label>2.1.</label><title>Clinical specimens</title><p>The study received approval from Taizhou People&#x02019;s Hospital Institutional Review Committee (KY2022-162&#x02013;01).

Prior to starting the study, informed consent was obtained from all participants. The recruitment process for PCOS patients followed Rotterdam inclusion/exclusion criteria established in 2004 which required confirmation of HA through either oligo-ovulation/anovulation or ultrasound examination showing ovarian polycystic changes.

A growing body of research evidence shows that HA and oxidative stress play a major role in the occurrence and development of PCOS. Several studies have shown that there is a high level of ROS production in PCOS patients [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and the over-androgen-stimulated ROS production leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which is the most important site for ROS production. An increase in the number of damaged mitochondria exacerbates oxidative stress, creating a vicious cycle [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. At the same time, other reports have found that the level of mitophagy in PCOS patients is also higher than that in normal people [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and improved mitophagy can help cells remove excess or dysfunctional mitochondria [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], thus improving the intracellular microenvironment. Therefore, research into treatments targeting mitochondrial dysfunction has the potential to break this vicious cycle and prevent or mitigate oxidative stress and the progression of PCOS. CISD2 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial functional regulation, energy metabolism regulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis regulation, and ROS production. In this study, we found that the expression of CISD2 is elevated in PCOS patients, and inhibition of mitochondria-associated protein CISD2 has protective effects on oxidative stress and mitophagy under excessive androgen stimulation.</p><p>Our study showed that the expression of oxidase NOX2 and mitophagy-related proteins Pink1 and Parkin were significantly increased in follicular fluid granule cells of PCOS patients, and the expression of CISD2 protein was also significantly increased. These data suggest that <italic toggle="yes">CISD2</italic> may play a key role in the occurrence and development of oxidative stress and mitophagy in PCOS diseases. Interestingly, our results showed that when we inhibited <italic toggle="yes">CISD2</italic> with shRNA in the testosterone-stimulated model, the expressions of mitophagy-related proteins Pink1, Parkin and LC3B were significantly increased, and mitochondrial and lysosome colocalization was also significantly activated. These results suggest that inhibition of CISD2 as a regulator of intermitochondrial connectivity can enhance mitophagy mediated by Pink1-Parkin. In our subsequent study, we found that the oxidative stress damage of cells was significantly improved when the expression of CISD2 was inhibited to activate mitophagy. Inhibiting the expression of CISD2 can reduce the production of ROS, increase the expression of antioxidant enzyme SOD2, and improve the intracellular environment, thus maintaining the stability of the follicular microenvironment. A large number of studies have shown that mitophagy is double-sided, and a certain degree of mitophagy can devour damaged mitochondria [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and reduce the production of ROS [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] to maintain cell homeostasis. However, excessive mitophagy can cause cell apoptosis or pyroptosis [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our study found that in the PCOS disease model, the level of mitophagy was increased in the presence of CISD2-shRNA, and the enhanced mitophagy would phagocytose the damaged mitochondria, improve overall mitochondrial function, reduce the production of ROS, enhance the expression of antioxidant enzymes, and improve cellular oxidative stress. Other studies observed that <italic toggle="yes">CISD2</italic> overexpression protects the liver from oxidative stress and reduces the occurrence of mitochondrial DNA deletions [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The reason for these varied results may be that CISD2 has a special [2Fe-2S] cluster whose biological function involves the transfer of electrons and Fe-S clusters [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], so CISD2 acts differently depending on the redox conditions in the cell. CISD2 is unable to transfer [2Fe-2S] clusters when the intracellular environment is in a reductive state. However, only when cells are under oxidative stress does CISD2[2Fe&#x02013;2S] in the mitochondria transfer [2Fe&#x02013;2S] clusters to apoproteins, and electrons from NADH to oxygen or ubiquinone [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43&#x02013;45</xref>]. In an oxidizing environment, CISD2 contributes to oxidative stress and production of superoxide radicals (O<sup>2&#x02212;</sup>) by transferring iron to the mitochondrial matrix and electrons to oxygen through the oxidation of NADH (the electron donor) [<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These results suggest that inhibiting CISD2 expression can save ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction in oxidative state, improve mitochondrial quality control, and play a protective role in cells. Therefore, our findings provide a new possible etiology for PCOS disease, and <italic toggle="yes">CISD2</italic> may be a therapeutic molecular target for mitochondrial dysfunction during PCOS.</p><p>Our study has some limitations, including the lack of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experiments and study of specific signaling pathways in which CISD2 likely plays a role. In future research, we plan to establish a <italic toggle="yes">CISD2</italic> conditional knockout mouse model to study its main physiological functions and specific signaling pathways in mice with PCOS, for a more comprehensive evaluation. In addition, CISD2 is located in the ER-mitochondria contacts (MERC) and has important regulatory effects on the mitochondria and ER [<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our previous studies have also found that HA induces ER stress in the FF of GCs from PCOS patients by causing inflammation, thus inducing NLRP3 expression and pyroptosis [<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Whether <italic toggle="yes">CISD2</italic> regulates the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum stress in PCOS still needs further study (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).
