The acute effects on neuronal firing rate are particularly well established. Namely, the electric fields generated within the brain by transcranial current stimulation can incrementally polarize cell membranes [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and thus modulate ongoing cell firing [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The effect acts at the time scale of the neuronal membrane (~30 ms) and thus is relevant for direct current (DC) and most effective for alternating currents (AC) of 30 Hz or less [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This acute neuromodulatory effect can be predicted from the orientation and intensity of local electric fields [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These cellular mechanisms established with in vitro animal experiments, also point to network effects [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which can be properly studied only in the intact brain.</p><p id="P7">However, despite numerous in-vivo animal studies in the intervening decades [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], there is still a lack of clarity as to whether the effects observed are clinically relevant, for one simple reason: in vivo animal experiments have not adequately characterized electric field magnitudes in the brain. In particular, a significant gap has emerged [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] between electric fields measured in vivo in the human brain, which are at or below 0.5 V/m [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and field intensities used for in vitro animal experiments, which are mostly at or above 5 V/m [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, it is difficult to interpret and link results from in vivo animal experiments to cellular effects observed in vitro. Nor is it clear that the in vivo animal experiments have any relevance to the behavioral effects observed in human clinical studies.</p><p id="P8">To close this gap, we measured electric fields magnitude and their effects on neuronal firing rate in vivo in rats and established calibrated computational models of current flow. To do so, we first calibrated our recording equipment on a phantom, and performed in vivo field measurements in cortex and hippocampus in a rodent tES model. Then, using high-channel count probes (Neuropixels2.0 [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) we analyzed firing rate of individual putative pyramidal and interneurons in response to short DC stimulation. This is best done in the hippocampus because there is a well-defined orientation of pyramidal neurons relative to the applied electric field [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and we can distinguish between putative pyramidal and interneurons using extracellular recordings [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and optogenetic stimulation [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our hypothesis is that firing rate is modulated by acute somatic membrane polarization [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, we will measure firing rate effects on a short time scale of 3s, which allows for repeated trials to identify small effects. To distinguish from the usual 20 min constant current stimulation protocol of tDCS, we refer to stimulation here as tES.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><label>2.1.</label><title>Characterization of recording and stimulation system using agar phantom</title><p id="P9">Brain phantom was constructed using a 26.7 mm diameter spherical container (30 ml syringe). To provide T1 and T2 relaxation comparable to gray matter, we followed the recipe by Schneiders et al. [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A 10 mM Nickel Chloride mixture was prepared: 2.377 g [Ni(Cl2)&#x000b7;6H2O] per 1 L H2O * 2.377 g of Nickel Chloride in 1 L of distilled water. The agar mixture was prepared as: 3600 ml H2O, 400 ml 10 mM Ni(Cl2), 120 g Agar, 20 g NaCl (0.5 %) and 1 g of Sodium Azide. The mixture was heated until boiling until the agar was completely dissolved. The boiling liquid was poured into the phantom using a funnel. All air bubbles were removed by creating a vacuum in the syringe. The phantom was let cool down and a 30-mm cylinder was cut for in vitro calibration of recording and stimulation devices (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

To confirm the accuracy of our recording system (RHD USB Interface Board, Intan Technologies) and determine if any signal distortion is introduced, we applied stimulation at different frequencies (1, 10, 100 and 1000 Hz) and at different intensities (100, 150 and 200 &#x003bc;A, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

For the measurement of the voltage values generated during stimulation within the phantom, we used two custom-built tungsten electrodes (two recording channels each electrode, 56.3 &#x000b1; 19.8 kOhm impedance at 1 kHz, mean &#x000b1; SD, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

The magnitude of the electric field increased linearly with stimulation intensities as expected (100, 150 and 200 &#x003bc;A, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 1E</xref>). However, the slope of the electric field decreased during 1 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

Two tungsten wires were inserted into the stainless-steel tube (2-channel shank). Wires were positioned 5 mm from the end of the tube. Wires were separated (ch-1 and ch-2) 1 mm apart from each other (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>). Ultra-liquid superglue (Loctite 1647358, Henkel, Germany) was applied on both ends of the tube and between wires. Two, 2-channel, single shank devices were attached to a mechanical shuttle (microdrive) or a 2 by 4 mm printed circuit board) making a 4-channel, 2-shank device.

The header pin connector to Omnetics adapter was soldered to connect tungsten wires to preamplifier headstage (#C3324, Intan Technologies Inc., CA). Impedance of the wires were measured by RHD USB interface board from Intan (Intan Technologies LLC, CA, USA).

We made an incision on the head and on the chest wall. A 10 by 10 mm platinum mesh electrode (Goodfellow, PT00-MS-000110) was sutured to the pectoral muscle and an insulated cable was tunneled to the top of the head of the animal. The skull was cleaned by hydrogen peroxide (2 %) and a stimulation pocket was attached to the skull using dental cement (1.5 mm anterior to bregma and 3 mm lateral to midline). The pocket was filled with conductive gel (Signagel Electrode Gel) and a 3 by 3 mm platinum stimulation electrode was inserted inside. The pocket is open at one side to expose the skull to the electrode and gel, but isolate it from surrounding tissues. A craniotomy was performed on the temporal bone (1.44 mm anterior from bregma and 3 mm deep from the top of the skull) and the dura was removed. The tungsten device was inserted to the target depth (2.4 mm from the surface of the brain).

Varying frequencies (10, 100 and 1000 Hz) at varying intensities (10, 20 and 40 &#x003bc;A) were delivered through the stimulating electrodes. Electric field was measured by fitting a sinusoid to the recorded voltage differences between the 4 contacts, averaging amplitudes of the two parallel measures, and dividing by the electrode distance (1 mm). This results in a 2D field vector, with magnitude given by the norm of this vector.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>2.5.</label><title>Stimulation and recording of in hippocampus of anesthetized and freely moving rats</title><p id="P14">The skin of the head was shaved.

Electric field was measured by fitting a sinusoid to the recorded voltage at each recording site. We first calculated the average peak-to-peak voltage on each site (n = 500 cycles), and then calculated the first spatial derivative of these voltage values across shanks. An average hippocampal electric field was calculated after localizing the cellular layer of the hippocampus using electrophysiological markers (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, n = &#x000b1; 32 channels were averaged around the center of the pyramidal layer).

The low-pass filter cut-off was at 55 Hz, and the band-pass filter was from 80 to 200 Hz.

In montage 1, Platinum plate electrode (3 &#x000d7; 3 &#x000d7; 0.1 mm<sup>3</sup>) was positioned above the primary motor cortex (2 mm lateral and 1.5 mm anterior from bregma) over the exposed skull by smearing a thin layer of conductive electrode gel, whereas the return electrode (Platinum mesh) was placed inside the chest wall (10 &#x000d7; 10 &#x000d7; 1 mm<sup>3</sup>). In montage 2, a Platinum plate electrode (2 &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; 0.1 mm<sup>3</sup>) was immersed into a conductive electrode gel and secured over the temporal bone by a plastic electrode holder on each hemisphere of the rodent head.</p><p id="P20">An adaptive tetrahedral mesh of rat model resulting from multiple mesh refinements was generated using a voxel-based meshing algorithm and contained &#x0003e;8 M tetrahedral elements and was solved for &#x0003e;10 million degrees of freedom.

All remaining outer boundaries of both models were electrically insulated. Electric field at the primary motor cortex and hippocampus, mimicking experimental recording sites, was predicted and peak value was reported.

The number of animals was selected primarily to capture variation in field magnitude across animals due to the exact location of recording electrodes. No rats were excluded from the analysis. Each animal served as its own control, no randomization or blinding was employed. Statistical analyses were performed with MATLAB functions or custom-made scripts. To measure the effect of electrical stimulation on spiking, peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were built around stimulus onset (spike trains were binned into 10-ms bins). Baseline and tES-induced firing rate were calculated for each single unit. Baseline was defined as tES-free epochs (3 or 4 s) between trials and stimulation period as the electrical stimulation was on (3 or 4 s). Firing rate change was measured in percent by dividing spike count with the mean count per neuron (taking maximum of stimulation and baseline mean counts) times 100. Where we analyze effects (firing rate change or field magnitude) as a function of stimulation intensity we report Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient R with corresponding p-values. To measure the efficacy of stimulation at the lowest intensity tested (&#x000b1;25 &#x003bc;A in 3 freely moving rats) we combine firing rate changes across all trials and neurons and compute slope as % change in firing rate per V/m (assuming 15 V/m ~ 1 mA) averaged over all neurons and trials. To obtain a null distribution for this slope, we randomize the label of stimulation intensity (&#x02212;25 &#x003bc;A, 0 &#x003bc;A, 25 &#x003bc;A) with replacement within each trial. We repeat this bootstrapping procedure 10,000 times. Where we compare firing rates between two conditions we use a Wilcoxon rank sum test.

After characterizing our stimulation and recording system using agar phantom (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>), we measured field intensity intracranially and built an anatomically detailed computational model of our electrode montage. In our experimental setup we applied sinusoidal alternating current (10, 100 and 1000 Hz at 10, 20, 30 and 40 &#x003bc;A intensities) in two anesthetized rats. We used sinusoidal signals because the quasi-static approximation of Maxwell&#x02019;s equations is valid for these frequencies in the brain [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and extracellular amplifiers cannot measure DC potentials due to the built-in high-pass filters (bandwidths ranging from 0.1 to 10 kHz). We used low amplitude sinusoidal signals to avoid amplifier saturation during electric field measurements. To electrically isolate the animal from the metallic stereotactic frame, we 3D-printed a non-conducting nose holder and ear bars (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>, Clear V4 resin, Formlabs) and placed the animal on a non-conducting surface. A platinum electrode was affixed to the skull over the forelimb motor cortex (1.5 mm anterior to bregma and 3 mm lateral from midline) within a chamber loaded with conductive gel. The pocket to hold gel and tES electrode was made of dental cement (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> by 3 mm, GC Unifast). The return electrode was a platinum mesh (10 by 10 mm) implanted in the chest wall [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This electrode montage provided electro-chemical stability and free range of movements in behaving rats. To measure the electric field generated by transcranial stimulation, we used a multi-channel, custom-built recording electrode matrix (n = 4 channels in total, 2 channels per shank, 1 mm distance between shanks and channels, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

We found that electric field magnitude increased linearly with stimulation current, with similar slope at the three stimulation frequencies (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, slope: 15.0 V/m/mA). In a second animal we measured fields of twice this magnitude (not shown, slope 30.0 V/m).</p><p id="P23">We developed a high-resolution (0.1 mm<sup>3</sup>) MRI-driven healthy rat computational model with eight tissue masks (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="S7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; for details) and predicted electric field magnitudes at the experimental recording sites. At the motor cortex location corresponding to the in vivo field recordings (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, black circle) the model estimates an electric field of 0.602 V/m (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This corresponds to 15.05 V/m per mA and is within the range measured in-vivo. Although it should be noted that there is a strong gradient as one moves radially (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) - moving just 1 mm closer to the stimulating electrode the electric field per applied current doubles to 30 V/m per mA - and the recording matrix has 1 mm side length, which may explain the variation across animals.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><label>3.2.</label><title>Measurement and modeling of tES-induced electric fields in hippocampus of rats</title><p id="P24">The field measurements and model established that 40 &#x003bc;A stimulation can induce 0.6&#x02013;1.2 V/m fields in motor areas. The exact field magnitude strongly depends on the recording location and thus, it has to be measured in the precise region of interest. We were interested in neural responses in the hippocampus, and so we decided to measure fields again with the same electrodes we will use for recording neural activity. We implanted Neuropixels (NP) 2.0 probes [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in the intermediate CA2 region of freely moving rats (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, n = 2 rats, 4.8 mm posterior to bregma and 4.6 mm lateral to midline, angled at 10&#x000b0;). We applied electrical current through two skull electrodes (2 by 2 mm platinum plates), but this time affixed to the temporal bone bilaterally (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We took advantage of the 5120 contacts available on the NP 2.0 probe, to select 384 channels for recording from each shank. We chose a single shank, linear configuration spanning 5760 &#x003bc;m (15 &#x003bc;m separation per channel) to record electric potential during sinusoidal tES (100 Hz, n = 500 cycles, at 10, 20, and 30 &#x003bc;A intensity) sequentially from each of the 4 implanted shanks. (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). As expected, we recorded higher voltages on the most lateral shank (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, shank-4 was closest to the stimulation electrode, each shank is separated by 250 &#x003bc;m). Additionally, we recorded higher voltage values following the curvature of the brain surface which likely reflects shunting caused by cerebrospinal fluid in the meningeal space [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To measure the electric fields in the hippocampus, we first localized the cellular layer of CA2 using electrophysiological markers (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The pyramidal layer of the hippocampus can be identified by the presence of sharp wave ripple oscillations and increased single unit activity [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The extracellular sharp wave (SPW) is produced by synchronous transmembrane currents in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, which is triggered by the synchronous CA3 inputs targeting the str. radiatum [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The CA3 volley also excites CA1 interneurons and their interaction induces the ripple oscillation (80&#x02013;200 Hz) detected in the local field potential [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. After detecting sharp wave ripples in the local field potential (LFP) signal, we calculated the ripple triggered average signal across 48 channels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, left; 12-channel steps corresponding to 180 &#x003bc;m inter-site distance) and we identified the channel with maximum ripple power (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, left; highlighted channels in red). We determined the position of individual neuronal somata using spike sorting and spike-amplitude trilateration (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, right [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]). To calculate the hippocampal electric field, we used &#x000b1;32 channels around the center of these soma locations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Similar to the motor cortex, we found that increasing stimulation intensity (10, 20 and 30 &#x003bc;A) induced increasing intracerebral electric fields (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, 0.1 &#x000b1; 0.01, 0.28 &#x000b1; 0.03 and 0.56 &#x000b1; 0.11 V/m, mean &#x000b1; SEM, n = 3 sessions from 2 rats, R = 0.76, p &#x0003c; 0.001). This corresponds to 10, 14 and 18.7 V/m per mA and thus somewhat less than the cortical measures, as expected. We will assume 15 V/m per mA in the remainder. To simulate our experimental setup, we placed electrodes over the parietal bone (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). We applied 100 &#x003bc;A current through one skull electrode while grounding the other skull electrode. The model predicted an electric field of 2.1 V/m in white matter and 1.2 V/m in gray matter in the hippocampus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). This corresponds to 12&#x02013;21 V/m per mA of applied current and is consistent with what we observed in the experimental recording above. As expected, the magnitude of the electric field dropped with distance from the cortex but increased at the boundary of white-gray matter transition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><label>3.3.</label><title>Intensity and polarity dependent effects of single unit activity induced by tES</title><p id="P25">Single-unit action potentials are the most direct measurement of neural activity.

We performed these measurements using the same rats where we measured electric fields and using the same recording and stimulation electrodes. tES was applied for 3 or 4 s and repeated hundreds of times with 3- or 4-s intervals of no stimulation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

Depending on the polarity of the stimulation, putative single units either increased or decreased their spiking activity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; slope: 3.75 % per V/m, R = &#x02212;0.33, P &#x0003c; 0.001, n = 510 neurons).

We have tested higher intensities in a urethane anesthetized rat and found that the effects did not saturate. Specifically, negative current stimulation (radially outward) increased the spiking rate by 37.22 &#x000b1; 5.13 % (&#x02212;400 &#x003bc;A), while positive stimulation (radially inward) decreased the activity of neurons by &#x02212;25.4 &#x000b1; 4.51 % (400 &#x003bc;A, n = 68 neurons, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 7</xref>). When we looked at the pattern of the tES induced firing rate in freely moving rats, we found that the highest intensities (&#x000b1;300 &#x003bc;A) were followed by either a rebound excitation or inhibition that is likely a network effect (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Figs. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>). Comparing the effects of tES on spiking in the awake rats vs. the anesthetized rat, we found that urethane anesthesia reduced both the spiking rate of excitatory cells (0.88 &#x000b1; 0.03 Hz, n = 394 neurons vs 0.42 &#x000b1; 0.08 Hz, n = 47 neurons, mean &#x000b1; SEM, awake vs. anesthesia, respectively, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

To confirm the opposing effect on spiking activity of hippocampal cells underneath the anode and cathode, we recorded from both hippocampi simultaneously using two, 32-channel silicon probes in an anesthetized rat [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To be clear, electrode polarity (anode vs cathode) changes throughout the experiment. Our modeling results anticipated that the electric field&#x02019;s magnitude would be comparable in both hemispheres, but with opposing orientation relative to the orientation of pyramidal neurons. Neurons under the cathode were excited (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, blue neuron, putative pyramidal cell with a mean firing rate of 1.14 Hz), whereas those under the anode were inhibited during tES (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, purple neuron, putative pyramidal cell with a mean firing of 0.67 Hz, n = 400 trials, 500 ms stimulation followed by 1 s stimulation free epochs). This is the expected direction of effects given that hippocampal pyramidal neurons have the opposite orientation to cortical-surface neurons and therefore radially outward currents under the cathode are soma-depolarizing for hippocampal neurons, whereas radially inward currents under the anode are soma-hyperpolarizing [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p id="P26">To quantify the strength of the effect, in particular at lowest intensities tested (&#x000b1;25 &#x003bc;A) we analyzed the spike counts combining data across all neurons (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The sensitivity measured as % firing rate change over applied electric field was 11.3 % per V/m (7.2, 16.0, 18.3 for the 3 animals that were measured at &#x000b1;25 &#x003bc;A, p &#x0003c; 0.0001 bootstrap shuffling &#x02212;25, 0, +25 stimulation labels, n = 62712, 43392, 11037 trials).

Further analysis of cell type specific effects revealed that a subset of neurons (13 out of 578 cells) responded to tES in a manner opposite to the overall average response of the population (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). While 3 s periods of constant tES induced acute intensity dependent changes in spiking activity during stimulation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), this tES failed to induce long-lasting effects when comparing spiking activity 30 min before and after tES (n = 575 single units from 4 freely moving rats, Pre: 0.96 &#x000b1; 0.048 vs. Post: 1.089 &#x000b1; 0.06 Hz, mean &#x000b1; SEM, p = 0.38, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</p><p id="P27">The usual assumption is that pyramidal neurons are preferentially affected by tES due to their morphology [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, tES also affected interneurons, mostly with the same polarity as pyramidal neurons. We hypothesized that this is a consequence of the pyramidal cell activation. To test this, we used transgenic mice where we can selectively stimulate excitatory cells in the CA1 region. We delivered brief pulses of blue light (405 nm, 100 ms, n = 100 trials) in a head-fixed, awake transgenic mouse expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) exclusively in CamKII expressing excitatory cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

We found that 100 &#x003bc;A currents induced 1.5&#x02013;3 V/m in motor regions and 1.0&#x02013;2.0 V/m in the hippocampus. Taking advantage of the 5120 contacts available on Neuropixels2.0 probes, we measured the electric fields using 1536 channels in the hippocampus. As expected from the model, electric fields decrease with distance from the stimulation electrodes. Using large-scale electrophysiology in freely moving rats, we found that neuronal firing was modulated by tES with a monotonic dose-response by about 11 % per V/m. This is above the effect sizes reported in previous in-vitro literature [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or in-vivo literature [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The importance of field orientation has been demonstrated repeatedly, starting with Chan and Nicholson (1986) [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Previous studies in rodents were either performed under anesthesia [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or did not optimally align electric fields with the main neural axis [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Therefore, we ascribe the increased efficacy of the present study to the fact that neurons are closer to firing threshold in the awake state [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and a more careful alignment of electric field orientation to the main neural axis.</p><p id="P29">Our results here were obtained in the hippocampus but we believe that results should apply similarly to pyramidal cells in the cortex. Like in the hippocampus, cortical pyramidal cells are oriented orthogonally to the surface. Field orientation relative to the cortical surface is therefore the main determining factor of somatic membrane polarization which affects firing rate [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In our preparation we found field intensity in cortex and hippocampus to be comparable despite the difference in depth, which the model explains as the result of lower conductivity of hippocampal tissue.

Translation of preclinical findings is difficult because in vivo animal experiments have not measured field intensities and estimates suggest that they are ten-fold compared to humans [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To bridge the gap between human and animal work, and to increase rigor, it is important to know the actual magnitude and direction of field intensity in the target brain region. We recommend measuring the electric field in situ using sinusoidal waveforms at three different intensities. In order to calibrate the recording hardware [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], we also recommend testing the stimulation and measurement systems (recording electrodes and amplifiers) in a phantom. We measured field intensity intracranially in the motor cortex and hippocampus and built a computational model to match our electrode montages. Using state-of-the-art computer models, we can now estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields. Our high-resolution model predicted rebounds in the electric fields (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). The non-monotonic decrease in electric fields is due to heterogeneous electrical conductivities of the head tissues [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This heterogeneity has a significant effect on the electric field distribution during tES [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Both the electric field and the current density are boosted in low-conductivity tissues resulting in increased magnitude of the electric fields in the low-conductivity tissue. The maximum value of the electric field occurs at the tissue boundaries [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These effects are determined by the conductivity of the different tissues and by the shape of their boundaries.</p><p id="P31">Currently available stimulation electrodes (saline filled cup or epicranial screw electrodes) cannot be combined with large-scale electrophysiology because of physical constraints [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. To overcome this limitation, we developed a biocompatible permanent gel/electrode enclosure affixed to the skull and combined it with high-channel count electrophysiology and behavior in freely moving rats. This conductive gel loaded chamber provided stable current delivery to the brain and prevented chemical change at the electrode-tissue interface [<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In many cases this is trivial to manage but with increasing invasive electrodes, higher dose, and irregular placement of electrode/electrolyte, an extreme chemical change could in theory disintegrate the skull and damage the brain.</p><p id="P32">While it is clear that the efficacy of tES depends on stimulation intensity, duration, polarity, and electrode montage (size, location, and number of electrodes) [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], there is no reliable evidence that higher stimulation intensity is always more effective [<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The generation of action potentials in vivo depends on the overall synaptic drive, and subthreshold tES-induced electric fields act as a bias to action potential generation. This implies that there is no strict lower threshold for field intensity to modulate the likelihood of action potential generation. However, low intensity tES will succeed only if the neuron membrane is depolarized enough to affect firing (close to its spiking threshold). Our in-vivo measurements in rats showed that low intensity tES (&#x0003c;1 V/m) can have a significant effect on average firing rate. Previous studies have shown that affecting even a small number of neurons has significant behavioral effects. Previous studies have shown that affecting even a small number of neurons has significant behavioral effects [<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. While this is true, it is also well established that certain disorders might require the activation of hundreds of thousands of neurons (deep brain stimulation for Parkinson&#x02019;s disease) [<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] or more than 10 V/m intracranial fields (tES for absence seizures) [<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p id="P33">The present results may also speak to the long standing debate on the effects of endogenous electric fields on neuronal firing [<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Electric fields generated during theta rhythms in the hippocampus of rats [<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] can be in the range of 1&#x02013;2 V/m and up to 2 V/m during slow waves in the visual cortex of ferrets [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. New evidence that such weak fields can have an effect on neuronal function comes from in vitro experiments [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as well as computational modeling [<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. These studies mostly demonstrated a modulation of the timing of rhythmic neural activity, and relied on highly coherent rhythms that are not commonly observed in vivo. The present work extends this earlier work by demonstrating effects on firing rate for fields as low as 0.5 V/m at times scales of 3 s in vivo.</p><p id="P34">A caveat of our study is that we only analyzed acute effects on firing rate, using only short intervals of constant current stimulation (3&#x02013;4 s). We did not aim to document lasting effects beyond the period of stimulation, although that is the primary goal of most clinical interventions with tES. A prevalent theory for long term effects of direct current tES (tDCS) is that it affects synaptic efficacy [<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. There is ample in-vitro evidence that DCS can boost synaptic plasticity [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. These effects all involve an acute boost of neuronal firing in pyramidal neurons, not unlike what was observed here. Indeed, modeling studies suggest that the observed synaptic effects are due to only a small subset of active neurons [<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Effects on synaptic plasticity have been demonstrated in-vitro down to 2.5 V/m [<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. There is no reason why the effects observed here in vivo on firing rate at 0.5 V/m would not similarly affect synaptic plasticity.</p><p id="P35">We recorded from the intermediate hippocampus because the orientation of pyramidal cells is parallel to the applied fields [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This ideal alignment made pyramidal cells more susceptible to electric fields. This effect was the most striking at low tES intensities. Furthermore, neurons are symmetrically located in the left and right intermediate hippocampus providing an experimental setup in which we could test soma-depolarizing and -hyperpolarizing effects simultaneously. Our bilateral hippocampi measurements confirmed that soma-depolarizing and -hyperpolarizing effects are occurring simultaneously in the two hemispheres with opposing signs (depolarizing tES increased, while hyperpolarizing tES decreased the spiking of neurons). On the cortical surface inward current (anodal tES) will depolarize the soma of pyramidal neurons, while it will hyperpolarize the soma of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus due to their opposing anatomical orientation [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the reverse is true for outward currents (cathodal tES). When stimulation electrodes are placed on the head, it is important to consider both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing effects.</p><p id="P36">Neurons are embedded in networks that are influenced by tES differently. The effect of electrical stimulation is non-specific affecting any neuronal soma, and depending primarily on cell morphology relative to local field orientation [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The symmetric morphology of inter-neuron suggests that their soma is not meaningfully polarized by electric fields. That they responded here similarly to pyramidal neurons is likely the result of monosynaptic drive from excitatory neurons, as we demonstrated with targeted optogenetic stimulation of pyramidal neurons. However, the spike rate increase in interneurons did not always correspond to the spike rate of monosynaptically connected pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. Indeed, pyramidal neurons on opposite hemispheres were positively affected, as expected given their cytoarchitecture. Therefore, the connectivity of individual inter-neurons may be the primary driver of how they respond to tES. A small subset of pyramidal neurons also responded opposite to other pyramidal neurons in their immediate neighborhood. As CA2 is curved it is possible that these pyramidal neurons were not aligned with the field orientation and thus their soma were minimally polarized, so that activated interneurons inhibited their firing. These findings suggest that effects on individual neurons are governed by the orientation and shape of the neuron relative to the electric field, as well as their connectivity to the network of neurons.</p><p id="P37">In conclusion, we have shown that neuronal firing rates are acutely affected in vivo at clinically relevant field magnitudes providing a viable mechanistic explanation for the effects observed with tES in human experimentation. Future work will need to establish whether these acute effects translate into long term effects, for instance, by modulating synaptic plasticity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS2004000-supplement-1.docx" id="d67e987" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P38">We thank Gy&#x000f6;rgy Buzs&#x000e1;ki for useful comments on the manuscript.
