However, PD is often compromised by catheter malfunction (CM), predominantly triggered by omental wrap and catheter obstruction, leading to technical failure in PD [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;2</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that omental wrap is responsible for 3.7% to 13% of CM [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>]. Furthermore, a high incidence of mechanical omental wrapped of the peritoneal dialysis catheter (PDC) has been observed in patients undergoing laparoscopy for CM, with rates spanning between 57.1% to 88.9% [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;7</xref>]. This clinical complication often requires laparoscopy or open surgical technique to recover the function of PDC, as conservative treatments yield limited success. Given these circumstances, the establishment of an appropriate animal model for omental wrapped-caused catheter malfunction (OWCM) is crucial for propelling fundamental research. However, few studies have addressed animal models of PDC wrapped by omentum. Jack Moncrief et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] detailed an animal model developed by altering the position of PDC. This procedure appears labor-intensive, time-consuming, and lacks definitive confirmation of catheter wrapped by the omentum in the abdominal cavity. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel animal model for PD omental wrapping employing a negative pressure suction technique, which is closely similar to the actual occurrence of omental wrapped. This model provides a reliable foundation for conducting basic research on the management of mechanical omental obstruction of the PDC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" disp-level="1" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2001"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>This study followed the guiding principles of the Chinese Animal Protection Committee, complied with the ARRIVE guidelines (<ext-link xlink:href="https://arriveguidelines.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://arriveguidelines.org</ext-link>), and was approved by the Ethics Committee of 900th Hospital of Joint Logistics Support Force (IRB approval number 2022-014).

We gently pressed the lateral abdomen, and recorded the average COFV for five minutes when the dialysate outflow became discontinuous. Once the COFV dropped below two ml/min, the negative pressure suction was sustained for an additional five minutes before turned off.

Nonetheless, all five Beagles had good activity levels and normal diets. All indicators, including dialysate RBC count, dialysate WBC count, were within the normal range, presenting no symptoms of peritonitis, tunnel exit-site infection, incision infection, or bleeding.

Current management strategies for this complication are challenging. While laparoscopic techniques and open surgery are effective in addressing omental wrapping complications, they pose invasiveness and entail anesthetic risks. Notably, the previous reports indicated omental wrapping is one of the major factors for the failure of catheter recanalization by conservative methods which treat it <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> catheter lumen [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;10</xref>]. Consequently, establishing a model for OWCM becomes paramount in the quest for an effective and safe treatment. Additionally, with recent advancements in interventional technology, Paul Li et&#x000a0;al. employed two guidewires which showed promise in restoring catheter malposition with the high success rate while circumventing the risks associated with open surgery and laparoscopic techniques [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The safety of treating omental wrapping can be enhanced through noninvasive treatment methods. Therefore, modeling OWCM is crucial in finding an efficient method <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> lumen to successfully address omental wrapping.</p><p>However, there is a lack of research focused on developing a reliable animal model for studying CM due to omental wrapped. Existing studies have reported low success rates and limited evidence for the effectiveness of such models. In our study, we successfully established an animal model of OWCM using negative pressure suction. The intra-abdominal abnormalities observed during laparoscopy after modeling closely resembled clinical findings, providing a solid foundation for further fundamental research on the prevention and treatment of omental wrapped in PD.</p><p>Numerous studies have highlighted the suitability of Beagles for constructing uremic PD animal models [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;13</xref>]. Beagles possess ample omental tissue and a spacious abdominal cavity, making them ideal for simulating catheter-related mechanical complications such as omental wrapping, catheter migration, and dialysate leakage. Earlier investigations have indicated that Beagles serve as appropriate experimental subjects for developing PDC malfunction due to omental wrapping [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Considering the size of a Beagle&#x02019;s abdominal cavity, a pediatric PDC was used in this study. The primary characteristics of omental wrapped of PDC are that the side holes and tip of PDC are encapsulated and obstructed by omentum [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>]. The negative pressure may attract free omental tissue gathering around the PDC and even block catheter during the dialysis fluid discharge process [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Thus, we att empted to establish a model of OWCM by negative pressure suction. Meanwhile, we found that negative pressure had a significant effect on omental wrapped leading to catheter drainage function <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> experiments. Our result showed that OWCM could easily be induced with a negative pressure over 62.5&#x02009;mmHg with a success rate of 100%. Thus, we opted for a negative pressure setting of 62.5&#x02009;mmHg for the experiments involving Beagles.</p><p>In subsequent animal experiments, we take routine open operation to insert straight PDC and used a negative pressure of 62.5&#x02009;mmHg to build OWCM model. Firstly, we conducted a comparison of the COFV and the volume of residual dialysate before and after modeling. Following 115.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;38.3&#x02009;s of negative pressure suction, a significant decrease in the COFV was observed. The results indicated that the initial post-malfunction COFV was 32.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.6&#x02009;mL/min, which further declined to below 5&#x02009;mL/min finally. The outflow of dialysate was observed in the form of drips or intermittent threads. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the volume of residual dialysate, meeting the criteria for catheter dysfunction as mentioned previously. Through laparoscopy, we observed that omental tissue adhered to, wrapped the tube wall, some omental tissue, sucked into the side hole and tip that lead to block of the catheter eventually. All five dogs were successfully modeled, resulting in a 100% success rate in inducing CM. Meanwhile, catheter position was assessed on the day of surgery, the 3rd postoperative day, and the 7th postoperative day. One Beagle was combined with catheter displacement on postoperative day 7.</p><p>At days 0, 3, and 7, we evaluated the safety of the modeling procedure by examining dialysate indicators, including WBC and RBC, which remained within normal limits. Simultaneously, laparoscopy was conducted throughout the entire process, revealing no occurrences of bleeding, injury, or complications involving the intestine or other solid organs. The results indicated no signs of inflammation or bleeding. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the modeling procedure is safe in the short term.</p><p>In this study, we successfully established a model of OWCM using negative-pressure suction method which is easy to perform, time-efficient, and safety. However, several limitations of our study deserve mention. In our study, the negative pressure we used was not continuous. The relationship between the negative pressure and omental wrapping has not been clarified. More negative pressure groupings and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experiments still need to verify this. The validation of results was confined to a seventh-day postoperative period and thus, longer-term observations are warranted. Moreover, we did not investigate CM specifically related to coiled catheters, an avenue that future studies may wish to explore. Additionally, in clinical practice, omental wrapped of catheters often co-occurs with catheter migration. Hence, future research should consider developing a combined model that simulates both catheter migration and omental wrapped. Lastly, while our method successfully induced omental wrapping under negative pressure without observed complications such as hemorrhage or organ damage, the anatomical differences between animals and humans may lead to varied potential complications.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study offers a straightforward, time-efficient, and safe method for establishing an animal model of OWCM. This model provides a firm foundation for basic research and could serve as a platform for developing clinical treatments for OWCM in PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM9656" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="IRNF_A_2369695_SM9656.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. Laien Xue for technical support in animal experiment.</p></ack><sec disp-level="1" id="S0005"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The animal experiment protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of 900th Hospital of Joint Logistics Support Force (IRB approval number 2022-014).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0006"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>YG, XW, WW contributed to the study conception and design.
