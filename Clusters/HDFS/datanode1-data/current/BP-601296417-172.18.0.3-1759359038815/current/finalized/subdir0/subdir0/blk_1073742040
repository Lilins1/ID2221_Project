The loss of chromosome 3, i.e. monosomy 3 (M3) is a major prognostic factor in UM. The M3 UM, defined by the cancer genome atlas as class C or D,[ ] has a 33% and 63% 5-year metastatic risk, respectively.[ ] Class 2 gene expression profile (GEP) is another major unfavorable prognostic factor in UM, associated with a 5-year 41% metastasis-free survival rate[ ] and with the M3 status.[ ] Inactivating mutations in a tumor-suppressor ( ) gene on chromosome 3p21.1 were identified in 26/31 (84%) metastasizing UM.[ ] gene inactivation frequently occurs through the loss of one chromosome 3 allele and an additional mutation on the remaining allele.[ ]\n\nThe BAP1 immunohistochemical (IHC) stain has emerged as a valuable inexpensive prognosticator in UM. The loss of the nuclear BAP1 (nBAP1) protein expression by IHC correlates with somatic gene mutations, irrespective of the type of gene mutation.[ ] Additionally, loss of nBAP1 expression correlates with chromosome 3 ploidy.[ ] Tabuenca Del Barrio [ ] documented that BAP1 protein expression by IHC is a major prognostic factor of metastasis-free survival. See [ ] found that low nBAP1 IHC (staining of less than 33% of tumor cells per high-power field, assessed in 3 high-power fields) also correlates strongly with GEP class 2 and is equally accurate in metastasis prediction. Van de Nes [ ] and Patrone [ ] found that the loss of nBAP1 protein expression by IHC has a stronger correlation with patient survival than somatic gene mutation status.\n\nPlaque brachytherapy is the most common treatment modality for small and medium-sized UMs. Although Iodine-125 (I-125) plaque brachytherapy is a highly effective method for local tumor control, enucleation may be required for recurrent tumors or in eyes with treatment-related complications.[ ]\n\nThe comparative genetic data on nonirradiated and irradiated UM are mixed. Several studies showed that genetic profiling can be obtained in previously irradiated tumors.[ ] Hussain [ ] documented that in eyes that underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) 0–20 days postplaque brachytherapy, genetic studies were successful in all 102 cases. Onken [ ] showed that FNAB can be obtained postradiotherapy in 15 patients and Gold [ ] had similar findings in three patients. Thornton [ ] compared 172 tumors with preirradiation FNAB to 176 tumors sampled up to 284 days postradiation with comparable genetic results. The concordance of genetic studies between pre- and post-brachytherapy specimens was examined by Coupland [ ] who showed that chromosome 3 data did not differ before and after radiotherapy in 4 patients. Wackernagel [ ] demonstrated comparable chromosome 3 and 8 statuses in 5 patients. Other investigators noted some differences between the genetic profiles between nonirradiated and irradiated tumors. For example, Matet [ ] compared chromosomal status in endoresection specimens in 17 patients and found identical chromosomes 3 and 8 profiles in 94%, with 18% discordance in other chromosomes. Dogrusöz [ ] compared 36 irradiated globes to 291 primary enucleated globes and showed that karyotyping and FISH failed significantly more often in irradiated tumors, with more common and complex aberrations.\n\nSimilar to molecular genetic testing, immunohistochemical stains can be influenced by irradiation induced necrosis, tissue damage, and ischemia.[ ] Irradiation can also induce epigenetic changes that affect protein expression.[ ] The data on the reliability of BAP1 immunohistochemistry in the previously irradiated UM is scant. The study by Szalai [ ] included 18 patients with UM previously treated by plaque brachytherapy, proton beam radiotherapy, or ophthalmic artery embolization who underwent secondary enucleation and 22 patients with primary enucleation as treatment of UM. The investigators found a significant difference in nBAP1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry between patients with and without prior therapy, but specific information on the difference between the two groups was not provided.\n\nWe conducted this study to assess the reliability of the BAP1 immunohistochemical stain in prognostication of patients with UM, who underwent enucleation post I-125 brachytherapy."}

Ninety percent of these people live in low- and middle-income countries, where 90% of visual loss is preventable and treatable.[ ] In 2020, an estimated 78.8 million people aged 50+ had moderate to severe vision impairment, due to cataracts.[ ] Cataract continues to be the principal cause of blindness in populations aged 50 + years due to local barriers such as lack of transportation or people to accompany patients to appointments.[ ] Thus, community-based eye care initiatives are crucial in rural areas to reduce preventable blindness and improve access to eye care.\n\nPrimary eye care in rural and peri-urban areas, according to the World Health Organization (WHO),[ ] involves community workers identifying and referring people with low vision to higher-level services, and offering advice on lifestyle and behavioral changes to improve their eye health.[ ] Secondary eye care is at the district level and includes assessing visual function, refraction testing, prescribing low-vision devices, providing guidance on optical interventions, and referring to tertiary services when appropriate.[ ] Tertiary eye care involves advanced service by trained professionals at a well-equipped eye clinic or hospital.[ ]\n\nVarious eye care delivery models exist for rural and peri-urban areas, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. The Aravind model,[ ] successful in densely populated areas, may not be feasible in low-density rural communities due to resource constraints and administration requirements. Developing a more implementable eye care model is urgent, especially for Africa and other regions, with community ophthalmology having limitations. Empowering rural communities to sustain quality eye care independently is important. This study aims to examine existing models, gather perspectives from healthcare workers and experts, and propose practical and sustainable technological solutions for rural eye care. We also aim to highlight strengths and weaknesses, personal experiences, and identify areas of improvement. The perspective seeks to build a common understanding to address public health programs more effectively, proposing a standardized solution for delivering eye care in rural areas."}

In this context, the safety and efficacy of adalimumab (ADA; Humira ®, Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA) and infliximab (IFX; Remicade ®, Janssen Biotech Inc., Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA) treatments in cases of noninfectious uveitis have been reported in various studies.[ ] While IFX is still used off-label in the treatment of BAU in countries other than Japan, ADA has received FDA and EMA approval for the treatment of noninfectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis thanks to multicenter phase 3 studies, VISUAL-I-II-III.[ ]\n\nIn cases of Behçet’s uveitis, the use of imaging methods is very important for detecting the diagnostic features of the disease, disease activity, response to treatment, and structural changes that develop due to the disease. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows the noninvasive examination of posterior segment lesions, with cystoid macular edema being the most common in BAU cases. Quantitative macular thickness measurements can be made in the follow-up of BAU patients receiving anti-TNF- treatment.[ ] It is possible to evaluate the choroid histologically and cross-sectionally using the enhanced depth imaging (EDI-OCT) mode of existing OCT devices. Ishikawa .[ ] have shown that subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) increases during an attack of Behçet’s uveitis.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to retrospectively analyze and share the demographic characteristics, clinical course of ocular findings, development of complications, final visual prognoses, and final OCT findings of patients who were diagnosed with BAU. These patients were divided into three groups: those treated with IFX, those treated with ADA, and those who switched protocols between these two treatment modalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first three-way comparison of BAU patients in Turkey who underwent treatment with only ADA, who were treated with only IFX, and who were treated with both protocols."}

Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of time spent studying online grew exponentially. Most elementary and secondary school students spend a lot of time engaged in near-work activities, resulting in an increase in the prevalence of myopia.[ ] Studies have demonstrated that children with myopia, particularly those with myopia at a young age, are prone to acquire extreme myopia if the condition is not treated,[ ] which can lead to visual impairment and even blindness.[ ] This has resulted in widespread interest in pediatric eye health. Analyzing the current situation of myopia in children and adolescents and developing focused interventions have become a pressing issue that must be addressed immediately. Langzhong served as the site for this investigation. Using digital equipment and big data, we learned for the first time about the current state of myopia and related behavior in children and adolescents in Northeast Sichuan. We then used this information to support and theoretically ground the implementation of myopia prevention and control programs by education and health departments."}

To include these infants, we extended our GA screening criteria to ≤33 weeks. Unfortunately, ROP screening program has substantial costs, and serial eye examinations with indirect ophthalmoscopy put infants at risk of both stress-related physiologic changes as well as significant pain.[ ] Identifying ROP risk factors beyond GA and BW could help minimize the number of unnecessary eye examinations and in focusing resources to high-risk infants.\n\nOur objective was to develop prediction models, including a predictive score model and a risk factor-based algorithm, to anticipate severe ROP in preterm Thai infants.
