These materials, which combine the flexibility of organic materials with the functionality of optoelectronic components, have drawn a lot of attention because of their potential uses in a variety of disciplines, such as medical equipment, wearable electronics, and soft robotics. Recent advancements in material science and device design have significantly improving performance, durability, and functionality of these stretchable organic optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, flexible conducting transparent electrodes play an essential role in a wide range of flexible and transparent electronics, including touch screens, displays, and solar cells. Traditional materials like indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, while effective, and constrained by their fragility and high cost. Recent innovations in alternative materials, such as metal mesh, nanowires, conducting polymers and graphene have ushered in a new era of affordable, flexible, and transparent conductive electrodes. Materials like graphene, metal nanowires, metallic grids, metal meshes, and dielectric-metal-dielectric electrodes are explored as potential substitutes for fragile ITO electrodes, thanks to their excellent combination of mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity. This abstract delves into the opportunities and challenges in the development of flexible and transparent organic optoelectronic devices and flexible conducting transparent electrodes. In this review, we explain the technological advancements of transparent and stretchable electrodes, as well as their applications in organic optoelectronic devices such as organic and perovskite solar cells, OLED, heaters, and supercapacitors. We will specifically examine the basic characteristics, optoelectronic properties, and manufacturing procedures of transparent conducting electrodes. We also discuss the key criteria for evaluating proposals for new research lines in this burgeoning sector.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Optoelectronics</kwd><kwd>Fabrication technique</kwd><kwd>Transparent electrodes</kwd><kwd>Coatings and printings</kwd><kwd>Stretchable electrodes</kwd><kwd>Conducting polymers</kwd><kwd>Graphene oxide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The rapid growth of modern stretchable and transparent optoelectronic consumer products including solar energy cells, optoelectronic skins, screens, transistor, supercapacitors, and smart windows has led to the design and development of Stretchable transparent conducting electrode (STCE) materials on a worldwide scale. Many electrical and optoelectronic technologies, including touch screens, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), photovoltaics and transparent heaters, depend on these electrodes in some way. Flexible and transparent optoelectrical devices are a novel class of mechanically stretchable electronics that are gaining popularity and optical transmittance of the devices are thought to be one of the key technologies for the applications of the future generation of electronics. In the last 10 years, the market for touch screens and electronic displays has expanded dramatically. Emerging device technologies also need for new transparent electrode features such mechanical flexibility, high optical transmittance simple production methods, low cost, and light weight [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Organic optoelectronic devices have an advantage over conventional inorganic electronic devices in that they may be built on transparent and elastic substrates, providing better elastic flexibility and longer effective life under mechanical deformation. In addition to their excellent electrical performance, these devices operate at low temperatures, are easily accessed over a large and affordable area, and may be used to adjust optical properties through molecular engineering. These features make them highly sought-after gadgets. Stretchable organic optoelectronics is a potential technology that may be used to create user-friendly integrated electronic systems containing a variety of functional components, including photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and thin-film transistors (TFTs). Studies on optoelectronic devices that may be applied to human skin and tissue have previously suggested that practical biological uses for these devices may exist. For example, patients are released from location-based constraints when their physiological status can be reliably, constantly, and correctly monitored. The retrieved medical data may be immediately sent to licensed specialists for diagnostic evaluation, enabling patients to get real-time at-home self-healthcare without experiencing any disruptions to their regular activities. Therefore, it is expected that both industry and academics will gain from the extraction of biometric data at human-machine interfaces via wearable smart sensing integrated systems [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> schematic device configurations and illustrative images of a Thin Film Transistor (TFT), an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), and an Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) respectively First of all, there is a high need for novel varieties of flexible, stretchy, or foldable substrates [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic device configurations of a Thin Film Transistor (TFT), an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), and an Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) respectively [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Illustrative image of Optoelectronic device like OLED, OPV.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0025">The substrates, which must have low atmospheric moisture and oxygen penetrability, high optical transparency, lesser resistivity, lower surface thickness, low surface roughness, and superior bending capability, are a key factor in mechanical flexibility or stretchability.

The discovery of conducting polymers and electroluminescence in molecular crystals increased interest in such materials in the 1960s and 1970s. However, during the past 30 years, there has been a considerable increase in interest in the field of organic optoelectronics because of significant advancements in material design and purification that have significantly improved the performance of the materials [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">Over the past few decades, optoelectronic technologies such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photovoltaics and laser have been widely used in many areas of modern life, such as consumer electronics, telephony, and solid-state lighting [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Because of the unique properties that set organic semiconductors apart from their inorganic counterparts, OSCs have been extensively studied and employed in several electrical devices since their inception. Nearly all organic devices are thin-film multilayer devices, like organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), which employ organic layers as the functional layers and metal layers as the electrodes.</p><p id="p0040">Interfaces between organic materials and metal are therefore essential for enhancing device performance [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

In contrast, a flat sheet of paper cannot be readily extended or freely distorted in any other way without breaking. For instance, a flat sheet of paper may easily bend when folded. A thin sheet of rubber, on the other hand, may be bent, repeatedly stretched, squeezed, and then released without permanent distortion. Therefore, a device must allow for extension, compression, and stretching in addition to bending to be deemed stretchy [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.

Another crucial optical characteristic is optical haze [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. TCEs' sheet resistance (R<sub>sheet</sub>) and optical transmittance at 550&#x000a0;nm (T<sub>550nm</sub>), which is the wavelength at which human eye sensitivity is at its highest, may be used to characterize and compare their optoelectronic characteristic in general [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

A wide range of practical applications were made possible as early as the 1950s by the development of wide band-gap semiconductors with high optical transparency (&#x0003e;80&#x000a0;%), such as SnO2 and In2O3, and the ability to increase their conductivity by the doping of impurities. Thus, both at the laboratory and industry levels, there is a whole industrial ecosystem and body of knowledge related to TCOs. The most popular TE materials today may be made using advanced vacuum-based sputtering techniques, thanks to more than 60 years of intensive research on indium tin oxide (ITO) films with excellent optical and electrical characteristics. ITO is not appropriate for several applications, especially flexible devices, due to concerns with its ceramic nature and indium shortage. The substantial progress achieved in the quest for novel materials with improved attributes, such more flexibility, stability, a plentiful supply of raw materials, and reduced processing expenses, has threatened the ITO's dominance in the sector. Three primary types of materials are being researched as TE possibilities in addition to TCOs: (i) Conductive polymers such as poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly (styrene sulfonate); (ii) Carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene; (iii) Metallic nanostructures such as thin metallic films, metal nanowire or fibre networks, or metal grids [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p id="p0060">ITO's most serious issues might potentially be resolved by these nanomaterials, as demonstrated by the numerous research that have been done on them. Promising candidates among the alternatives are metal-based thermoelectric (TEs) because of their high intrinsic electrical conductivity, their ability to use nanostructures to achieve high optical transparency, and their high propensity to acquire additional properties like stretchability, flexibility, tuneable bandgap alignment, and haziness when combined with other materials. As early as 1877, sputtering and evaporation techniques were used to study and create metallic TEs. It's noteworthy to note that, even though ITO is today the most widely used TE, the earliest recorded uses of TEs were on selenium photoelectric cells in the 1880s, when metallic ultrathin films, such those of silver, gold or platinum, were used. In the beginning, ferroelectric memory, imaging devices, transparent heaters on aircraft windows (for de-icing and de-fogging systems), and solar energy conversion were among of the applications that attracted a lot of attention to metal- and oxide-based TEs. Because metals maintain their high free-electron density (&#x0003e;1022 cm-3) at the nanoscale, metallic nanomaterials are appealing as TEs. The greatest electrical conductor at room temperature is Ag, which has a conductivity of 6.3*10<sup>7</sup>&#x000a0;S/m. As a result, materials based on Ag have a strong chance of functioning as effective TEs. Even though electrodes made of Ag nanostructures have been the subject of several investigations, other metals, such as Cu and Ni&#x02013;Cu, are now also being investigated. The ductility of metals, as opposed to TCOs, is another benefit. This ductility is further improved when the metal is sculpted at the nanoscale. Contrarily, a disadvantage of having a high free-electron density is that homogeneous metallic layers often have low optical transmittance due to metals' high reflectivity. To increase the transparency of metallic-based TEs, several initiatives have been made. Examples of effective TEs include ultrathin metal films and non-continuous metal nanostructures like periodic metal grids and random metal nanowire networks. Although ITO has been employed in a wide range of applications, not all applications call for the same TE standards [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p id="p0065">Flexible TCEs need to have outstanding optical, electrical, and mechanical characteristics in order to be used in flexible and stretchable or wearable optoelectronics [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], such as OLEDs, OSCs, and touch screens. ITO conductor has become the most widely used TCE material for OLEDs and OSCs in recent years. For commercial ITO thin films, optical transmittance in the visible region is around 80&#x000a0;%, and sheet resistance (Rs) is typically 20 <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.svg"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003a9;</mml:mi><mml:mo linebreak="goodbreak" linebreakstyle="after">/</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. However, the rare and delicate nature of ITO prevents future advancements in flexible optoelectronic technology. To find alternatives, a variety of materials have been investigated as potential ITO replacements. Six kinds of TCE materials have been suggested for use in OLEDs and OSCs, or organic optoelectronic devices. In this review, we focus on these materials: conductive polymers, graphene-based electrodes, metallic nanowire electrodes, doped metal oxides, hybrid graphene-metallic nanowire electrodes, metal meshes, and dielectric-metallic-dielectric electrodes. The primary traits that are reflective of these six categories are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Transparent heaters</title><p id="p0070">The Joule effect serves as the foundation for Transparent heater. J.P. Joule (1818&#x02013;1889) used experimentation to prove Joule's law, which says that the quantity of heat emitted per unit of time when an electrical current I passes through a homogeneous conductive material with an electrical resistance R is equal to I<sup>2</sup>R. Through a balance between heat loss and the Joule effect, the power wasted in the material is directly correlated with the steady state temperature attained. The three main physical origins of these thermal losses&#x02014;thermal conduction to the substrate or through conducting connections, convection to the surrounding air, and radiation emitted from the hot surfaces&#x02014;are schematically depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. These losses represent the total heat transfer from the thermocouple [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].Increasingly popular as defogging windows and mirrors, transparent heaters and unique resistors that can both produce joule heat and allow visible light through are becoming more and more in demand. Transparent heater performance is primarily determined by two key parameters: optical transmittance and sheet resistance. Transparent heaters with high TR are ideal for periscopes and car windshields, among other applications that need unobstructed vision. In addition to requiring low input power, low sheet resistance is also necessary for sustaining a high saturation temperature quickly [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Optical transmittance and sheet resistance must typically make concessions to one another. Due to its exceptional optoelectronic qualities, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) has had a long-standing dominance in the transparent heating business. The limited flexibility, sluggish temperature response, and rising cost of indium source, however, prevent ITO from finding wider industrial use. Nowadays, metal nanowires (NWs), metal wire meshes, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and other hybrid films are being considered as viable alternatives to indium tin oxide (ITO) as transparent conductors or heaters. Because of the high contact resistance between nearby nanotubes and sheets, carbon-based transparent heaters are among those with high RS. Thanks to its high electron concentration, metal NWs and meshes have far superior electrical conductivities. A nonuniform thermal distribution is the consequence of chemically manufactured metal NWs' propensity to cluster together during solution-based dispersion operations [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of transparent heater.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0030">Fig. 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Stretchable electrodes and flexible substrates</title><p id="p0075">On stiff substrates that are often brittle and undeform able, traditional electrical and optoelectronic devices are constructed.

Stretchable electronics has the potential to create new classes of deformable and stretchable memory, displays, photovoltaics, sensors, electronic skin, energy storage devices, and supercapacitors, revolutionizing the technology of the electronics sector. It is crucial at this point to define the term &#x0201c;stretchable&#x0201d; considering the review's subject and for clarity. Stretchable systems must be more than merely bendable; they must also be flexible.

FESCs, like conventional supercapacitors, are primarily made up of functionalized electrodes, collectors, and an electrolyte. Given that its components must be flexible, FSCs achieve exceptional electrochemical performance by 1) using high-performance, flexible electrodes and 2) employing a flexible electrolyte and collector. Good flexibility is equally crucial for wearable and portable supercapacitors as electrochemical performance. FSCs can exhibit a variety of features and abilities depending on the components used, including compressibility, stretchability, bendability, and twisting.

These carbon compounds may act as both electrodes and current collectors and typically have exceptional flexibility and high conductivities. Since the electroactive powder components of the flexible ECs are joined together without the need for binders, conductive additives, or separate current collectors, they are simpler to use than standard ECs. Thus, these adaptable ECs need to exhibit the next two strategic advantages: (1) Device structures: Freestanding carbon materials are used directly as the electrodes and current collectors, whilst soft plastics (such as Teflon films, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, polyethylene terephthalate, and polydimethylsiloxane) are commonly used as the packaging. As a result, these streamlined ECs save a significant amount of weight and space in addition to being thinner, lighter, and more flexible than traditional ECs. (2) Electrode materials: To create an initial paste for classic ECs, certain binders and the crushed electrode material are required. The matching electrodes can then be made by placing the produced paste on a current collector [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, these processes should inevitably lead to the following issues: The long electron-conducting channels in the carbon component are broken down by the asymmetrical mixture of powdered components. Electrolyte cannot penetrate the electrodes because of (i) blocked electroactive material sites; (ii) obstructed electroactive material sites; and (iii) poorly linked void volume, commonly known as &#x0201c;dead volume,&#x0201d; in the electrodes. Electroactive chemicals may be swiftly poured into flexible carbon scaffolds to form the electrodes for flexible ECs. This sort of EC is surprisingly device-ready, able to pick a carbon substrate to regulate the pore's geometry, and capable of sustaining continuous electron-conducting pathways across the macroscopic carbon scaffold. They can therefore achieve incredible electrochemical performance [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><label>5.2</label><title>Conductive polymeric films</title><p id="p0090">Flexible screens and solar cells have gained attention due to their mobility, low weight, and thinness.

UV ozone treatment is often used to boost PEDOT: PSS work function, but treated films show a two-orders-of-magnitude greater resistance than untreated ones.

Transparent conductive thin films, or TCFs, are essential parts of many optical-electronic systems, including liquid crystal displays, solar cells, touch panels, solar cells, electromagnetic shielding glass, and organic light-emitting diodes [<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Metal NWs (Ag NWs and Cu NWs) are now seeing a surge in popularity among loading materials because of their exceptional mechanical and electrical qualities. Additionally, metal NW networks are easily coated using a straightforward and affordable solution coating technique, and they may be distributed like ink. Despite being 100 times less expensive than silver, copper has less stability than silver, thus Cu NW networks perform substantially poorer optoelectrical than Ag NWs. Consequently, Ag NWs have become one of the most promising components of the transparent electrodes of the future [<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the materials and their optical transmittance and low sheet resistivity of Ag and Cu NWs and metal thin films.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.6"><label>5.6</label><title>DMD electrode</title><p id="p0150">An example of an electrode type that combines a metal film, a high-index dielectric layer, and a multilayer high-index dielectric layer is known. It features excellent transmittance along with low sheet resistance and remarkable flexibility. Specifically, the multilayer's high refractive index dielectric layers boost transmittance by reducing the metal film's reflection caused by destructive interference. Work on heat reflecting optical filters was the starting point for earlier experiments on multilayer electrodes. ZnS/Ag/ZnS, WO<sub>3</sub>/Ag/MoO<sub>3</sub>, ZnS/Ag/MoO<sub>3</sub>, Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/Ag/ZnS applied to OLEDs are a few examples of multilayer electrodes that have been reported by several research groups so far in varied topologies [<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The Ag films used in these investigations, however, were thicker than 10&#x000a0;nm. Because an increase in Ag film thickness is required to make up for a drop in device transmittance, it may be difficult to fabricate exceptionally transparent OLEDs due to its thickness. The creation of very transparent devices therefore requires the ideal minimum thickness for continuous, low sheet resistance Ag films. As a result of the devices' inability to be transparent and flexible at the same time, multilayer electrodes were used in earlier experiments as either cathodes or anodes.</p><p id="p0155">Reduced transmittance and angular dependence are brought on by the microcavity effect when thicker metal sheets are placed on both sides. As a result, to create TFOLEDs that work, it is first required to address the issues raised in earlier research. OLEDs with multilayer electrodes and excellent transparency were suggested by Kim et al. The created TFOLEDs have better transmittance and can overcome the angular dependence brought on by the microcavity effect. Electron-only devices were created to regulate the ZnS and Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> layer thickness for the multilayer cathode. Changing the quantity and kind of dielectric layers allowed researchers to investigate the minimal film thickness for continuous Ag film. To increase TFOLED transmittance without sacrificing efficiency, this was done. Optical simulations were used to estimate the ideal ZnS layer thicknesses for antireflection on both the anode side and in the capping layer. PET was used to produce the TFOLEDs' optimal structures. The final product had a peak transmittance of around 550&#x000a0;nm of 74.22&#x000a0;%, and the observed and computed transmittances agreed. The suggested TFOLED design had J-V-L characteristics that were comparable to those reported in investigations where there was no efficiency loss. Additionally, under compressive stress, flexible multilayer electrodes on TFOLEDs remained flexible. Due to the excellent transmittance of these devices, there was little shift in the EL intensity spectra and CIE coordination at different emission angles. Calculations of the microcavity effect's effects were also minimal. We thus believe that the suggested TFOLED architecture is a potential one for use in transparent, flexible displays, as it circumvents issues with earlier work [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5.7"><label>5.7</label><title>Metal mesh</title><p id="p0160">The flexibility to adjust line width and line pitch to optimize for transparency and sheet resistance makes metal mesh electrodes a top contender for transparent conductors. Lower sheet resistance can be achieved at the expense of reduced transparency by increasing line width or decreasing line pitch. The metal mesh is covered with a transparent film to enhance the conductivity nature and show appropriate resistance and optical transmittance. The metal meshes are easily prepared from the electrospinning technique which is described in section <xref rid="sec7.15" ref-type="sec">7.15</xref> To emit light efficiently, OLEDs often require clear electrodes. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a popular transparent electrode material, although it has certain drawbacks, including brittleness and high production costs. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> illustrates the comparison of the transparent electrodes. Metal mesh electrodes, such as silver or copper, provide an alternate approach. They have strong electrical conductivity while being transparent, and they can be made cheaply using technologies like electrospinning, screen printing or photolithography. Metal mesh structures may be built into OLED displays to improve light extraction efficiency. Metal mesh substrates can provide OLED devices flexibility, allowing them to bend or twist without losing performance. Wearable electronics, curved displays, and vehicle illumination are all potential uses for flexible OLEDs. Metal mesh substrates are appropriate for flexible OLED applications because they are mechanically resistant and durable while yet preserving electrical conductivity. Metal meshes can also be employed in OLED devices as an encapsulating or barrier layer. These coatings protect the OLED's organic layers from moisture, oxygen, and other environmental pollutants, increasing its lifespan and stability. Metal meshes can act as conductive barriers, preventing moisture from entering the device structure and providing extra mechanical support. Metal mesh structures can be shaped into pixel arrays to regulate the light output of OLED devices. Pixelation and increased display resolution can be achieved by selectively activating different sections of the metal mesh electrode. This approach is particularly effective for large area displays and signs. Overall, metal mesh provides a diverse framework for improving the performance, functionality, and longevity of OLED displays. Metal mesh, by harnessing its unique qualities like as transparency, conductivity, and flexibility, can overcome critical issues in OLED production and enable the creation of next generation displays.<fig id="fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Diagram illustrating the trade-off between commercial ITO glass and a few possible ITO substitutes, such as graphene, metal nanowires (MNWs), metal mesh, conductive polymers, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs).</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0040">Fig. 7</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Functions and recent advancements in the optoelectronic devices</title><sec id="sec6.1"><label>6.1</label><title>Functions and recent advances in OLED</title><p id="p0165">The two electroluminescent processes responsible for LED light emission are charge injection and radiative recombination at the p-n junction. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>a depicts an example of a standard LED device assembly, where the p-type and n-type layers combine to produce the interface's p-n junction.

The exceptional flexibility of the ultrathin OLED has been successfully used to show the LEDs with stretchy emission structures based on organic materials. The majority of flexible or stretchy substrates, on the other hand, are incompatible with ILEDs because they typically need high-temperature manufacturing techniques to deposit the single-crystalline inorganic layers. Alternative strategies include creating efficient ways to move ILEDs from substrates suitable with high temperatures onto stretchy or flexible substrates.

The electron and hole unite to produce the electron-hole pair known as an exciton because of their opposing charges. Exciton dissociation is the process by which the electron-hole pair split into a cathode and anode. To enhance charge transfer, a layer is positioned in between the active layer and the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode layer in both OLEDs and OPVs. In the case of OPVs, the layer is referred to as the hole extraction layer (HEL), and in the case of OLEDs, as the hole injection layer (HIL). The HIL or HEL layer that is most frequently employed for both devices, poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly (styrene sulfonate, or PEDOT: PSS). Electrostatically conducting conjugated PEDOT (positively charged) and negatively charged PSS (insulating) are gradually diffused in water to form polyelectrolyte PEDOT: PSS. Nevertheless, pure PEDOT: PSS clings to hydrophobic surfaces seldom, has a low conductivity, and is air sensitive. One way to employ nanoparticles (NPs) in stretchy or even flexible devices is to add them to the PEDOT: PSS layer, such as carbon nanotube, gold (Au) NPs, or silver (Ag) NPs.

Three kinds of photodetectors may be distinguished: photoconductors, photodiodes, and phototransistors. Each category has a unique device architecture and mode of operation. William Shockley invented the phototransistor, a kind of light-sensitive transistor, in 1951 [<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and it has since become one of the key components of optoelectronic integrated circuits. Phototransistors frequently have greater sensitivity and lower noise when compared to photoconductors and photodiodes.

Due to the explosive expansion of organic electronics and the potential application of OPTs in the next generation of portable, human-friendly electronics, research on OPTs has attracted a great deal of attention. When an incident light signal modifies the density of charge carriers in an OFET's (Organic Field-Effect Transistors) active channel, it is known as an OPT (Organic Photodetector). Comparatively speaking, OPTs outperformed regular photodiodes in their ability to detect optical signals. Also, they are easy to integrate into electrical circuits due to their design, which is like that of a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). Physical processes in OPTs include the following: absorption of light at a certain wavelength; production, diffusion, and dissociation of excitons; and transport of the resulting free charge carriers.

The chamber is sealed and pumped down to a high vacuum to remove any contaminants or gases. 3. <italic>Organic Material Source</italic>: Organic materials, such as small molecules or polymers, are loaded into a crucible or an effusion cell inside the vacuum chamber. The organic material is chosen based on its desired properties, such as emission color, efficiency, and stability. 4. <italic>Heating and Evaporation</italic>: The organic material in the crucible or effusion cell is heated to its evaporation temperature using resistive heating or electron beam heating.

The ink needs to be carefully developed to ensure proper viscosity, stability, and compatibility with the printing system. 2. <italic>Printing System Setup</italic>: The inkjet printing system consists of an inkjet printhead and a control mechanism. The printhead contains a series of tiny nozzles or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) that can selectively eject droplets of ink. The control mechanism controls the movement and positioning of the printhead. 3. <italic>Substrate Preparation</italic>: The substrate, usually a glass or flexible plastic material, is prepared by cleaning and treating its surface to ensure proper ink adhesion and uniformity. The substrate is typically mounted on a stage or conveyor system that allows for precise movement during the printing process. 4. <italic>Ink Ejection</italic>: The inkjet printhead moves across the substrate, and the control mechanism triggers the ejection of ink droplets from the nozzles. The droplets are formed by rapidly heating a small volume of ink, causing it to vaporize and expel from the nozzle. The droplets are then directed towards the substrate. 5. <italic>Droplet Placement</italic>: The droplets of ink are precisely placed on the substrate according to a pre-determined pattern or design. This is achieved by controlling the timing, position, and size of the ejected droplets. The printhead can rapidly switch nozzles on and off to create the desired pattern. 6. <italic>Layer-by-Layer Deposition</italic>: Inkjet printing allows for the sequential deposition of multiple layers to build complex structures. Each layer is printed and dried before the next layer is printed on top.

The spinning solution is loaded into a syringe and pumped through a fine spinneret under the influence of a high electric field. 4. <italic>Formation of Nanofibers</italic>: Apply a high voltage between the spinneret and the collector to create a charged jet of the spinning solution. As the solvent evaporates during flight, nanofibers are formed and deposited onto the grounded collector in a random or controlled manner. 5. <italic>Layer Deposition</italic>: Repeat the electrospinning process to deposit multiple layers of nanofibers corresponding to different OLED components, such as the hole transport layer, emissive layer, and electron transport layer. Each layer may require different spinning parameters to achieve the desired morphology and thickness. 6. <italic>Device Assembly</italic>: After deposition of the electrospun layers, assemble the OLED device by encapsulating the organic layers between suitable electrodes (e.g., anode and cathode). This may involve additional processing steps such as thermal annealing or deposition of additional functional layers. 7. <italic>Characterization and Testing</italic>: Characterize the fabricated OLED device using various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and optical spectroscopy to evaluate its structural and optoelectronic properties. Test the device performance in terms of brightness, efficiency, and stability under electrical operation. 8. <italic>Optimization and Scale-up</italic>: Optimize the electrospinning process parameters, material formulations, and device architecture to improve OLED performance and reproducibility. Scale up the fabrication process to produce OLEDs on a larger scale for commercial applications.</p><p id="p0420">Electrospinning technique is an impactful fabrication process which is used in the nanofibers, microfibers processing, nanogenarators etc. [<xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8"><label>8</label><title>Future perspective</title><p id="p0425">Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED), Organic Solar Cells (OSC) or Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) and Organic Phototransistors (OPT) or Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFT), their fundamental characteristics, and their potential uses were systematically discussed in this review paper, using notable examples from the literature to bolster our arguments. Since they have an organic semiconductor active layer and an accepted field-effect structure, organic phototransistors have special benefits. Furthermore, the molecular makeup of OSCs may be altered to suit certain purposes. They're better than their inflexible and typical inorganic competitors because of their soft nature and flexible structure. Large-scale manufacturing and prototyping have become more efficient and economical. One of the most critical application fields where flexible electrodes can be effectively used is optoelectronic applications, which includes characteristic of transmittance and resistance; wearable-flexible electronics; optical communication, which includes secure communication of encrypted information through optical memory storage; and environmental monitoring devices.</p><p id="p0430">Stretchable optoelectronic device development has recently made major strides, which has facilitated the creation of electronics that are human-compatible. Various stretchable organic optoelectronic devices, including those for energy harvesting (OPVs), light visualization (OLEDs), and sensing systems (OPTs and OPDs), were reviewed in this review along with their workings. We also detailed the steps needed to develop stretchable electronics with logical choosing materials and structural design by estimating their stretchability under various mechanical stresses. The study looked at both the historical development of organic optoelectronic devices and current research on cutting-edge applications.</p><p id="p0435">Current methods do not fully address the obstacles to producing more complex skin-compatible and human-friendly electronic gadgets. It will be necessary for future intelligent organic optoelectronic devices to integrate multifunctional devices and minimize feature size through precise and fast processing methods to accommodate for complexity. Stretchable optoelectronic devices adhered to human skin may be employed in biomedical diagnostic procedures, in a manner akin to that of smartwatches and smartphones. If long-term vital monitoring is available for patients getting remote diagnosis and supervision, people ought to find it easier to take care of themselves. Artificial sensory electronic devices aim to detect changes in temperature, mechanical, chemical, and physiological signals in the body by imitating human senses. The wellbeing of society can therefore be improved. Therefore, more research into fully integrated systems of optoelectronic components and other electronic components, including as batteries, long-range antenna systems, and electronic circuits, is required0. Stretchable organic optoelectronic device development will go more quickly in the future if we can better understand the underlying material properties and architectural designs of device architecture and create novel approaches to device integration [<xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>].</p><p id="p0440">Up till now, wearable, and flexible optoelectronic technologies have greatly evolved and changed our way of life. Innovative device topologies, light manipulation techniques, transparent conductive electrodes, and novel substrate materials are driving the evolution of high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices. The base is made up of transparent conducting electrodes that are incredibly flexible or stretchable, and the supporting element is substrate materials. The previously mentioned review covers a variety of TCEs composed of metallic nanowires, dielectric-metal hybrid structures, and graphene. The device's efficiency will increase if light extraction or trapping components are included. A new age of flexible and wearable optoelectronic devices will be ushered in by increasing commercial and technical needs. Future technology will undoubtedly allow for the development of electrical devices that can be rolled, folded, twisted, and even incorporated with the human body [<xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><label>9</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0445">As we peer into the horizon of upcoming electronics technology, one thing becomes abundantly clear: stretchable electronics are poised to assume a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of innovation. The extensive evolution of flexible transparent organic optoelectronic devices, as highlighted in this review, heralds an era where imaginative applications previously deemed unattainable with standard rigid electronics are now on the cusp of realization. The allure of stretchable electronics lies in their ability to adapt to arbitrary surfaces and incorporate movable components, a feat that remains elusive for conventional rigid electronics. This transformative capability opens the doors to an array of exciting possibilities. Stretchable electronic devices not only promise reversibly foldable and stretchable conformal integrated circuits but also wearable displays capable of transmitting information while allowing users to see through them. Furthermore, these devices extend their potential to encompass energy storage and communication solutions that can seamlessly conform to curved surfaces, such as building arches or the exteriors of automobiles. The realm of biomedical systems stands to benefit immensely from stretchable electronics, with the ability to integrate with the human body in ways that were once the stuff of science fiction. Imagine surgical implants that seamlessly harmonize with the body, revolutionizing the healthcare industry and patient care.</p><p id="p0450">Additionally, the emergence of stretchable electronics will also empower the creation of robotic systems featuring soft and mobile components, paving the way for more versatile and adaptable robotic technology. Our journey through the evaluation of existing literature has been a source of great satisfaction, as it has become evident that the field of stretchable electronics is brimming with promise and potential. The release of numerous high-quality papers across various journals reflects the dedication and ingenuity of researchers in this domain. With these remarkable advancements, it is only a matter of time before stretchable electronics take center stage in the future of technology, illuminating the path towards unprecedented innovations and applications.
