Three- or four-handed manipulations are usually required, yet maneuverability is usually limited by the single nare, thus an adjunctive corridor for an assistant is valuable. Most techniques prefer a combined septectomy for medial mass resection[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and a combined transmaxillary approach for inferior mass resection.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Here, we introduce two cases to illustrate a simple improvement for the transseptal technique. Specifically, our goal was to facilitate instrument maneuverability, especially for orbital cavernous venous malformation (CVM), one of the most common benign intraorbital malformations in adults. The advantages of this technique include its being minimally invasive and maintaining septal integrity, while greatly improving operation efficiency.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Patient Summaries</title><p>Case 1 (extraconal CVM in the right orbit): A 52-year-old female who complained of blurred vision in the right eye for 1 year was referred to our department by an ophthalmologist.

During this procedure, a septal window or partial septectomy at the mid-posterior of the septum is usually required, which may result in decreased smell and postoperative sinonasal morbidity.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] To reduce such damage, Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] described a technique for endoscopic transseptal suture retraction. However, it was difficult with this technique to either make a suture deep in the nose or provide dynamic retraction via a tread. The transseptal technique has also been reported. For example, three methods of medial rectus muscle (MRM) retraction were described by Chen, including the four-handed transseptal technique.[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In another case report, by Lao, a septal-preserving transseptal approach was described.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, this technique has not yet been commonly recognized in the field. For example, it was not mentioned in a recent review of endoscopic endonasal approaches to intraconal orbital tumors.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our experience, it is greatly helpful. Sharing its details here, with videos and figures, may facilitate its wider adoption.</p><p>Compared with the single-nare approach, the adjunctive transseptal corridor has many advantages. (1) With a transseptal corridor from the other nare, the assistant has adequate space for freedom of instrument movement. This greatly facilitates the assistant&#x02019;s ability to cooperate, including dynamic tumor retracting, suctioning, and drawing fat/muscle during mass resection. (2) Preserving an intact septum with nearly no evidence of septal trauma. (3) Avoiding sacrifice of the contra-side middle and superior turbinate, without olfactory disturbance. (4) Simultaneously harvesting the perpendicular plate for orbital reconstruction. (5) If the patient is affected by septal deviation, this can be addressed simultaneously. (6) Most importantly, this technique is quite simple.</p><p>Transconjunctival and endonasal access are commonly used in orbital tumor resection, each has its own indications and limitations. Transconjunctival access is more suitable for anterior lesions, allows operation under direct view, simple and rapid. However, visualization is usually unsatisfactory, especially when the mass extends posteriorly to the apex. The endoscopic endonasal approach offers benefits including superior visualization and remitted skin incision; however, it is difficult to manipulate through a single nare. The combined transconjunctival and transnasal endoscopic approach leverages the benefits of each.[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Now assistant cooperation through a transseptal corridor effectively solves problems, and additional transconjunctival access can often be avoided. In occasional cases, such as when the lesion is located extremely anterior, where it is difficult to make a wider angulation by a transseptal corridor, transconjunctival access may afford greater advantages.</p><p>The transnasal endoscopic approach is theoretically indicated for any mass size, especially large masses distending into the ethmoid sinus. This approach can also be adopted by oculofacial surgeons who are familiar with nasal cavity anatomy and proficient in endoscopic techniques. Of course, a collaboration between rhinologists and ophthalmologists may be optimal.</p><p>Postoperative complications like enophthalmos and diplopia may occur after endoscopic endonasal orbitotomy; rigid reconstruction of the medial orbital defect with a perpendicular plate can prevent such adverse events. However, it is also critical to attend to increased orbital pressure or pupillary abnormalities after reconstruction; if any abnormalities are noted, we may remove reconstruction when necessary. Of course, intraoperative attention and careful manipulations should always be focused constantly to avoid orbital apex syndrome.</p><p>As to septal perforation, because the incisions dislocate anteriorly and posteriorly, theoretically it is impossible. Even if a perforation is occasionally caused by severe deviation, it can be usually repaired by a local flap. In the case that it cannot be well repaired, small or posterior perforations cause few symptoms and generally need no treatment. Larger and anterior perforations contribute to nasal airflow disturbances, symptoms may include whistling, epistaxis, crusting, and pain which are needed for revsional rhinoplasty.</p><p>Overall, assistant cooperation by the transeptal technique is crucial for surgical success; retracting by the third hand greatly facilitates tumor separation and shortens the process. Besides CVMs, this technique is well suited to nearly all transnasal endoscopic orbital surgeries, because it just provides practical adjunctive access for multiple-handed surgical manipulation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Contributions statement</title><p>Haihong Chen and Yang Yang designed the work; Haihong Chen, Yang Yang, and Lifang Shen performed the surgery; Yang Yang drafted the paper; Haihong Chen and Lifang Shen revised and approved the manuscript; and Haihong Chen agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study was approved by the ethical committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (protocol # 2023-0145) which exempted it from requiring individual patient consent.
