{"pmc_id":"PMC467008","category":["Letters to the Editor"],"title":{"_VALUE":["Consensual eye intraocular pressure rise following unilateral glaucoma surgery"]},"authors":["Grassi, Piergiacomo"],"body_text":"Dear Editor,\n\nI read with interest the recent prospective study by Rajsrinivas [ ] describing intraocular pressure (IOP) increase in the fellow eye (FE) following ipsilateral glaucoma surgery. The authors reported a significant increase from the baseline IOP in FE at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively, and a maximum increase in FE IOP of nearly 3.5 mmHg when the index eye (IE) IOP was persistently <5 mmHg at 1 month postoperatively. Although the findings appear promising to evaluate IOP changes in FEs following ipsilateral glaucoma surgery, I noticed some critical points in the paper that I would like the authors to clarify.\n\nIn this series, 187 consecutive IEs that underwent surgery for primary or secondary glaucoma were included, whereas patients on systemic or topical steroids because of ocular or systemic conditions were excluded. I wonder whether the potential inclusion of IEs with uveitic glaucoma (UG) not on topical or systemic steroids may significantly bias the results, as intraocular inflammation and IOP may have not been adequately controlled at the time of surgery. In UG, active inflammation contributes to elevated IOP, and IOP may revert to normal once inflammation subsides.[ ]\n\nAlso, surgery was performed for primary open-angle glaucoma in 45.5% and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in 41% of IEs. However, preoperative IE lens status (phakic/pseudophakic) and possible mutations in the 1 gene were not specified for PACG patients. PACG eyes with bestrophinopathies have a higher risk of aqueous misdirection (especially if phakic),[ ] and the potential inclusion of these eyes may alter IOP results in IEs and FEs. Pars plana vitrectomy is an established treatment for aqueous misdirection in these cases,[ ] for RRD (including cases complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy) and with vitreoretinal interface syndrome.[ ]\n\nI commend the authors’ frank acknowledgment in the discussion of the limitations of the present study but seek clarification of the raised points."}

Vitamin (folate and B12) values of the patients included in the study were checked. Those who were within normal limits were included in the study. Neurologic examinations of the participants were performed. Those with any neurologic disease (including migraine) were excluded from the study. Smoking history of the participants was not questioned. This may be considered a limitation of our study. However, the effect of smoking on the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) is controversial. Although there are studies showing thinning,[ ] there are studies showing no change.[ ] Some studies have also shown that smoking affects one but not the other.[ ]\n\nIt is statistical that GCC is not significant in the inferior 3 mm. Measurements of the patient group (116.74 ± 13.47) and the control group (121.74 ± 8.90) revealed that the standard deviation was higher in the patient group. This difference seems to have affected the significance.\n\nAs our study was not suitable for drug evaluation in terms of number of patients and methodology, we grouped the patients as monotherapy and polytherapy recipients and compared them. We wrote in the limitations section that long-term and large-participant studies are needed to evaluate the effects of drugs and epilepsy on the retina.\n\nNil.\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest."}

A dilated fundus examination was performed for ROP staging on 410 preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 2.5 kg and a gestational week of less than 36, who were included in the study. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure and statistically analyze the HbF levels. The findings demonstrated that, in comparison to infants without ROP, infants with ROP had significantly lower HbF levels. A lower prevalence of ROP was linked to higher HbF levels. Higher HbF levels were seen in ROP infants who regressed naturally without medical intervention, whereas lower concentrations were seen in the infants who developed a severe illness and needed medical attention.\n\nThere are a few restrictions to take into account, though. First off, since the study was observational, it is impossible to prove causation. Furthermore, the study’s findings cannot be applied to other populations because it was only carried out in one tertiary care hospital in central India. The study only lasted 1 year and the sample size was quite small, so it is possible that it did not cover the full range of ROP outcomes. Furthermore, the study only assessed HbF levels at two intervals – the first visit and at a 1-month follow-up – so it was not possible to fully evaluate how the HbF levels changed over time. Furthermore, oxygen exposure and other genetic and environmental factors are examples of potential factors that may influence the development of ROP, but these were not evaluated in this study. In addition, in areas with a high incidence of thalassemia, background abnormal HbF is possible and it is difficult to apply HbF in this specific situation.\n\nFurther research is required to confirm these results and evaluate the relationship between HbF levels and ROP in a variety of populations. This will involve conducting larger multicenter studies with longer follow-up periods. A more thorough examination of HbF’s correlation with ROP would be possible through longitudinal studies that assess the levels of the protein at various points over time. Additional research ought to look into other possible causes and processes connected to the onset of ROP."}
