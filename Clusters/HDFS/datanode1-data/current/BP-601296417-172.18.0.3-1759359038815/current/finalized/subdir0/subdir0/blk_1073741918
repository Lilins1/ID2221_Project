Proportions of deaths within 30 days of discharge were estimated, and a comparative analysis of demographics, clinical characteristics, and influenza illness between decedents and survivors was performed using multivariable Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Among 23,360 patients with SARI (median age: 20 years, IQR: 1.5&#x02013;48, 65% male), 351 (1.5%) died during hospitalisation. Of 23,009 patients alive at discharge, 20,044 (87%) were followed, with 633 (3.2%) deaths within 30&#x000a0;days of discharge. In children (&#x0003c;18 years), difficulty breathing (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.1&#x02013;3.0), longer hospital stay (aHR 1.1; 95% CI 1.1&#x02013;1.1), and heart diseases (aHR 8.5; 95% CI 3.2&#x02013;23.1) were associated with higher post-discharge death risk. Among adults (&#x02265;18 years), difficulty breathing (aHR 2.3; 95% CI 1.7&#x02013;3.0), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4&#x02013;2.2), and intensive care unit admission (aHR 5.2; 95% CI 1.9&#x02013;14.0) were linked to elevated post-discharge death risk.

Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended to mitigate influenza-associated mortality. To enhance post-discharge outcomes, hospitals should consider developing safe-discharge algorithms, reinforcing post-discharge care plans, and establishing outpatient monitoring for recently discharged patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><funding-source id="gs1"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100000030</institution-id><institution>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, USA [<award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs1">U01GH002259</award-id>].</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Influenza</kwd><kwd>Post-discharge mortality</kwd><kwd>Severe acute respiratory infection</kwd><kwd>Surveillance</kwd><kwd>Bangladesh</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">
<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><sec id="dtbox1sec1"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="p0015">While sentinel surveillance provides valuable insights into in-hospital mortality among patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), there exists a notable dearth of information regarding post-discharge SARI mortality and its prevention. This knowledge gap is particularly pronounced in countries such as Bangladesh, where no comprehensive analyses or long-term studies have been undertaken. Understanding the risk factors associated with post-discharge mortality is crucial for the development of effective interventions aimed at reducing the burden of SARI mortality. Therefore, urgent research is needed to address this critical gap in knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0020">In this 8-year prospective study, we aimed to estimate the proportion of SARI-related deaths occurring within 30 days of discharge. We conducted a comparative analysis of demographics, clinical characteristics, and influenza illness between decedents and survivors. Approximately 5% of patients with SARI succumbed to the illness, with two-thirds of these deaths occurring within 30 days post-discharge. This highlights the potential oversight of deaths happening after discharge in understanding the true burden of SARI mortality in Bangladesh. Our findings revealed higher post-discharge mortality rates in infants and older adults, with most deaths occurring within the first week post-discharge. Factors such as comorbid conditions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and extended hospital stays were associated with post-discharge mortality. Additionally, our study indicated that influenza virus infections may contribute significantly (10%) to post-discharge SARI deaths.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0025">A comprehensive understanding of factors linked to post-discharge SARI deaths, particularly those associated with influenza, holds implications for policy decisions on prevention and control measures, including vaccination programs. The study's outcomes provide valuable insights for health authorities to formulate interventions aimed at enhancing patient outcomes post-discharge and preventing avoidable deaths. This long-term study addresses a crucial knowledge gap in Bangladesh, serving as a foundation for future research and interventions to mitigate the burden of SARI mortality.</p></sec></boxed-text>
</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">While in-hospital influenza deaths are readily quantifiable through sentinel surveillance, there is a paucity of&#x000a0;data on post-discharge survival, strategies for improvement, and the potential implications for our comprehensive understanding of global acute respiratory infection (ARI) mortality. Influenza, a vaccine-preventable cause of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), offers an avenue for understanding the added benefits of vaccination programs.</p><p id="p0035">SARI stands out as a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly affecting children under 5 years old.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> More than 90% of SARI-related deaths occur in developing countries, including Bangladesh,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> where influenza-associated SARI is prevalent and could play a significant role in mortality.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Globally, influenza is estimated to result in 3&#x02013;5 million severe illnesses and 291,000&#x02013;646,000 influenza-associated respiratory deaths.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p id="p0040">Death post-hospital discharge among patients with SARI remains insufficiently characterised, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Bangladesh.

From January 2012 to June 2016, SARI for individuals aged &#x02265;5 years was defined as acute respiratory illness with fever (or measured fever &#x02265;38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and cough or sore throat, with onset within the previous 7 days, necessitating hospitalisation.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> For those &#x0003c;5 years during the same period, SARI constituted severe pneumonia or a history of cough or difficulty breathing, accompanied by at least one danger sign: chest indrawing, stridor in a calm child, history of convulsions, inability to drink, lethargy, unconsciousness, or intractable vomiting within 7 days of hospitalisation.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Since July 2016, SARI for all ages has been classified as an ARI with fever (or measured fever &#x02265;38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and cough, with onset within 10 days of hospitalisation.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p id="p0060">Upon identifying patients with SARI and securing written informed consent, surveillance physicians enrolled participants, collecting data on demographics, smoking history, comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment, and outcome status at initial hospital discharge. Respiratory swabs (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) were collected, with all samples tested for influenza viruses using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) during the influenza season (usually during April&#x02013;September). From October to March, every second sample from patients aged &#x02265;5 years and two randomly selected samples from children aged &#x0003c;5 years per surveillance hospital each week were subjected to influenza virus testing using rRT-PCR. Subtyping was done for the samples positive for influenza A. The HBIS surveillance protocol received approval from the institutional review board of icddr,b (protocol #2007-002), with reliance approval from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Hospital discharge</title><p id="p0065">We gathered information on hospital discharge for each patient with SARI upon leaving the hospital. Discharge details were categorised as follows: (i) patients with a medical record indicating full recovery, (ii) patients or their families requesting early discharge, (iii) patients discharged early based on a physician's advice, and iv) patients referred to a specialised hospital. Premature discharge was defined when the patient or their family requested early discharge, and the early discharge was advised by a physician.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Post-discharge follow-up</title><p id="p0070">For discharged patients with SARI, we conducted a follow-up survey after 30 days (a timeframe utilised in several previous studies) to ascertain the outcome of the SARI episode. Field staff contacted the patient or a family member by telephone to inquire about the patient's status. If the patient was unreachable, they received up to three additional telephone calls. If the respondent was &#x02265;18 years and agreed to participate, or if the patient was &#x0003c;18 and provided assent and their parent or guardian consented, the follow-up interview was initiated with the patient, parent, or guardian. We collected information about outcomes, additional healthcare-seeking behaviours, or hospital re-admission for the episode. In the case of patient demise, family members or caregivers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to gather information on the date, place of death, and self-reported causes of death. Deaths due to road traffic accidents, poisoning, homicide, drowning, and other accidents were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="p0075">We analysed categorical variables using frequency and percentages, comparing the percentages using two-sample z-tests. Numerical variables were analysed using the median and IQR, and group comparisons were made using nonparametric equality-of-medians tests. We calculated the proportion of patients with SARI who died in-hospital and compared this to the proportion who died within 30 days after discharge, excluding accidental deaths. We quantified the case fatality proportion (CFP) of patients with SARI at discharge (in-hospital deaths or patients with SARI) and quantified the CFP of patients with SARI who died within 30 days after discharge (post-discharge deaths or cases who were discharged). Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves for 30-day post-discharge mortality were generated.</p><p id="p0080">Among children aged &#x0003c;18 years, potential risk factors for post-discharge deaths, such as age, sex, difficulty breathing reported on admission, duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission, length of hospital stay, ICU admission, and comorbidities (asthma and heart diseases) reported during hospitalisation, as well as the detection of influenza viruses, were assessed by comparing patients who died with survivors at 30 days post-discharge. Specific risk factors for post-discharge deaths for younger children, such as nutritional status, anthropometric measurements, social status of family members, and smoking history of children aged &#x0003c;18 years or their parents, were not collected. ICU admission data for children aged &#x0003c;18 years were excluded from multivariate analysis due to insufficient observation.</p><p id="p0085">Among adults aged &#x02265;18 years, potential risk factors for post-discharge deaths, including age, sex, difficulty breathing reported on admission, duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission, length of hospital stay, ICU admission, smoking history, comorbidities (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases) reported during hospitalisation, and the detection of influenza viruses, were assessed by comparing patients who died with survivors at 30 days post-discharge. Patients enrolled after May 2013, when self-reported comorbidity information was included, were considered in this analysis.</p><p id="p0090">Based on previous work<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and our experience, we classified variables into hierarchical levels for children aged &#x0003c;18 years (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S1A</xref>) and adults aged &#x02265;18 years (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S1B</xref>). The hierarchical levels included sex and age as the most distal level variables. For children, the second level included comorbidities (i.e., asthma and heart diseases) and the detection of influenza RNA through rt-PCR. The third level included difficulty breathing, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission as the most proximal level variables. For adults, the second level included smoking history. The third level included comorbidities (i.e., asthma, COPD, hypertension, diabetes, and heart diseases) and the detection of influenza RNA through rt-PCR. The fourth level included difficulty breathing, length of hospital stay, duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission, and ICU admission as the most proximal level variables. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a multivariable Cox regression model.</p><p id="p0095">Initially, all explanatory variables (potential risk factors) of each level were entered into their respective models. Initial risk factors at a 5% level of significance were identified for each level. Selected initial risk factors were jointly included in the model for each level, controlling for all variables retained in previous levels at a 10% level of significance. Variables were progressively excluded at each level, retaining only those statistically significant at a 5% level of significance.

While the demographic and clinical characteristics of our study patients are reflective of the regional population, caution is warranted when generalizing to other settings. The generalizability of our results may be relevant to LMICs with similar contexts, however, variations in healthcare delivery systems, cultural practices, and patient behaviors across regions could impact applicability. Future studies should replicate this work in diverse settings to confirm universal relevance of the identified risk factors and to develop broadly applicable interventions. The standardized data collection methods and validated tools used in our study enhance the potential relevance of our findings in other settings, although adaptations may be necessary for local differences. We encourage cautious interpretation when applying these results beyond the context of our study.</p><p id="p0205">Our study exhibits several strengths, utilizing a comprehensive approach over an eight-year span for a multicentre prospective observational study in Bangladesh. The inclusion of sites across Bangladesh, a large number of participants of all age, and an extended follow-up period after discharge fills a knowledge gap, shedding light on the imperative for interventions beyond the hospitalization phase. Our research found that around 5% of SARI patients admitted to hospitals died during the study period, with nearly two-thirds of these deaths occurring after discharge. This finding underscores the significance of recognizing the extended risk period for SARI-related deaths and identifying specific factors associated with post-discharge mortality. The study's prospective design and meticulous data collection provide a platform for future efforts to improve patient care after discharge. By utilizing this platform, we can develop interventions that enhance continuity and ultimately improve post-hospitalization survival.</p><p id="p0210">Our study had several limitations. First, we were unable to reach all patients with SARI after discharge; 13% of patients with SARI were lost to follow-up, which may bias estimates of post-discharge deaths. Second, causes of post-discharge deaths were reported by family members, which may not accurately indicate the actual cause of death. Third, there is a significant information gap between post-discharge death circumstances and in-hospital death circumstances, and family members were unable to provide more details about the course of illness surrounding post-discharge deaths. Fourth, we obtained data from our routine influenza surveillance platform; thus, we were not able to have specific risk factor data among children aged &#x0003c;5 years for post-discharge deaths, such as nutritional status, anthropometric measurements, and the social status of the family members of the younger children. Fifth, we only tested patients with SARI for influenza viruses and do not know the potential contribution of other aetiologies to the occurrence of both in-hospital and post-discharge deaths.</p><p id="p0215">Approximately 5% of patients with SARI died; of these, two-thirds occurred within 30 days post-discharge, indicating that deaths occurring after discharge may be unrecognised contributors to the true SARI mortality burden in Bangladesh. Post-discharge mortality was higher in infants and older adults, and most deaths occurred within the first week after discharge. The presence of heart diseases, difficulty breathing, and longer hospital stays was associated with post-discharge deaths among children aged &#x0003c;18 years. For adults aged &#x02265;18 years, the presence of COPD, difficulty breathing, and ICU admission was associated with post-discharge deaths. These findings suggest the utility of monitoring patients following discharge and reducing the occurrence of premature discharge may improve health outcomes of patients and potentially prevent post-discharge deaths. However, to reduce the burden of influenza-associated mortality, seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended. Also, future studies are needed to explore further the reasons for premature discharge, causes of post-discharge SARI deaths, and to identify preventable post-discharge deaths. Findings from such studies would inform resource allocation and interventions in Bangladesh to improve patient outcomes after discharge.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0220">Study conceptualisation: MAI, MZH, MR, WWD, EAB, ADL, FC; Methodology: MAI, MZH, MR, WWD, EAB, ADL, MAA, ZA, FC; Software: MAI, MZH, MKA; Investigation: MAI, MZH; Resources: MAI, MZH; Validation: MAI, MZH; Formal analysis: MAI, MZH; Data curation: MAI, MZH, MKA; Original draft preparation: MAI, MZH, MR, WWD, EAB, ADL, FC; Supervision: MAI, MZH, FC; Funding acquisition: MAI, MZH, FC; Visualisation: MAI, MZH; Project administration: MAI, MZH, FC; Writing&#x02014;review and editing: MAI, MZH, MAA, ZA, SC, MKA, MR, MZR, SM, MSU, TS, MSF,MR, WWD, EA, ADL, FC.
