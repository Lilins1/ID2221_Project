Developing a more implementable eye care model is urgent, especially for Africa and other regions, with community ophthalmology having limitations. Empowering rural communities to sustain quality eye care independently is important. This study aims to examine existing models, gather perspectives from healthcare workers and experts, and propose practical and sustainable technological solutions for rural eye care. We also aim to highlight strengths and weaknesses, personal experiences, and identify areas of improvement. The perspective seeks to build a common understanding to address public health programs more effectively, proposing a standardized solution for delivering eye care in rural areas.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Survey questionnaire:</italic> We used a semi-structured survey with both close-ended and open-ended questions in the English language. The survey questionnaires were finalized and validated with inputs from global healthcare experts in the field of community ophthalmology (AS, TR, and HT).

Additionally, participants were provided the option to complete the survey through assisted Zoom interviews, with RL transcribing the physicians&#x02019; responses directly into the online survey form. CognitoForms software (CognitoForms, V2, June 2022, Columbia) was utilized for administering the survey, and responses were gathered over a two-month period. All participants, regardless of their positions, were required to answer the same set of questions in the survey, with no grading based on participant experience or expertise. In cases where participants encountered difficulties in completing the survey, RL conducted supplementary online or in-person interviews to assist in the completion of the questionnaire.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Survey questionnaire details:</italic> The questionnaire was designed to describe healthcare workers/physicians&#x02019; and experts&#x02019; region of practice, hospital profile, resources, practice patterns, community ophthalmology involvement, and opinions about areas that need improvement in current eye care models for rural and peri-urban areas. In particular, survey participants were first asked for details regarding their region of practice and roles in the hospital. They were then asked questions to profile their surgical practice (if applicable&#x02014;only for surgeons) and asked to describe their typical pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative cataract surgery workflows. The survey participants were prompted to rate their agreement with statements regarding the current state of eye care delivery and eye care models on a 5-point Likert scale. Finally, the last part of the survey included open-ended questions regarding where physicians believe improvements can be made to community ophthalmology in rural settings, and how to best ensure sustainable eye care delivery and positive patient outcomes. The open-ended questions were designed to build on our quantitative findings by expanding on physicians&#x02019; thoughts and perspectives about whether we are having the impact we intend to have in these communities and where improvements need to be made based on their personal experiences.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Ethical approval and consent to participate:</italic> This study was reviewed and acknowledged as exempt by the institutional review board of a tertiary eye care institute in Central India.

A lack of transportation facilities and lack of awareness among patients indirectly leads to presenting at a later cataract stage and delayed presentation of post-operative patients with complications (post-operative endophthalmitis, iris prolapse, intraocular lens dislocation) at irreversible stages and accounting for iatrogenic blindness. Some other factors mentioned that may increase complication rates were poor patient hygiene and long-standing traumatic cataracts associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, faulty and unsupervised pre-operative screening and sterilization procedures, and malpractice from quacks.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Perspectives about the various eye care models for rural communities</italic>: The eye care model perspectives part of the survey demonstrated that 87% of participants agreed with providing primary eye care services in rural/peri-urban areas [<xref rid="IJO.IJO_2196_23-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>]. Likewise, more than 60% of the experts were not in agreement with the makeshift center model of eye care delivery. The &#x0201c;makeshift center&#x0201d; model of delivery of eye care services involves building temporary hospitals and surgical centers in local places such as schools or community centers. There was a wide range of opinions regarding the makeshift center model of eye care delivery, with approximately equal numbers (percentage/ratio) of physicians indicating strongly disagree, neutral, and strongly agree. The &#x0201c;fly-in fly-out&#x0201d; model of eye care delivery is when physicians from foreign countries or outside the region come to perform surgeries for a few days and then leave. The majority of respondents either agreed or were neutral about this type of eye care delivery, as they believed that occasionally when physicians from other institutions come to perform surgeries, there is a lot to learn from their surgical practice. However, the downside is that there must be a proper system in place to ensure the follow-up of those patients, or else their post-operative care will be neglected. Thus, there were no participants who indicated &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d; because the feasibility and sustainability of ensuring quality care with the fly-in fly-out model is low.</p><fig position="float" id="IJO.IJO_2196_23-F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Eye care delivery perspectives: Survey respondents were asked about their opinions on three prominent eye care delivery models (fly-in/fly-out, makeshift centers, and tertiary eye care hospitals supported by primary eye care outreach camps).

<xref rid="IJO.IJO_2196_23-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> demonstrates that most experts generally agreed that involving community-based workers and incentivizing them will be beneficial to the quality and sustainability of community ophthalmology practices. Based on survey responses, some ways to educate community health workers and change their attitudes toward adopting new methods or protocols are to provide periodic hands-on and practical workshops, refreshment classes, incentives through awards or conference presentations, and ensure that their work is facilitated with regular engagement to reduce frustration and unnecessary burden. The two main future technological advancements that the experts saw necessary to implement in rural eye care delivery models were electronic medical records for ease of documentation and telemedicine at outreach vision centers. Some systemic changes that could be made were to provide phacoemulsification to all cataract surgery patients, hire patient counselors, and promote more untold heroes of community ophthalmology to foster leadership and empathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The term &#x0201c;community ophthalmology&#x0201d; encompasses several components involved in the delivery of eye care in rural settings. This includes raising awareness of eye health in the community, conducting epidemiological research and community-based surveys, planning and management of comprehensive and sustainable eye care services, and training of primary eye care workers.[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] By surveying a number of physicians from less densely populated countries in Southeast Asia, we are hoping to better understand their perspective on delivering eye care to the community and the difficulties they face.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The semi-structured survey-based study will further enable us to gain a more holistic perspective on community ophthalmology in a wider range of rural settings beyond Southeast Asia. Our survey provided a broad range of opinions and insights regarding community ophthalmology that were used to direct the proposal of a more practical model of eye care delivery. As the experts participating in the survey had vast experience in primary eye care in rural settings, it provided further depth to the respondents&#x02019; breadth of knowledge.</p><p>Lack of resources including trained staff and the fragmented compromised cataract care pathway (pre-operative screening, intra-operative care, and post-operative care) can potentially result in iatrogenic blindness contributing to the burden of irreversible blindness.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Though the strengths of the temporary/makeshift center model are that it can benefit rural communities by bringing care directly to them, especially if it is solely primary eye care services where refractive correction can be provided instantly, for invasive eye care services, the surgical conditions such as sanitation, tools, equipment, and access to emergency care are less than ideal in makeshift centers, and this can pose serious medicolegal issues in some instances.[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, both the makeshift model, typically lacking essential infrastructure and standardized protocols, and the fly-in fly-out model, often facing challenges in sustainability and consistency, do not receive support from the regulatory system in India. This regulatory limitation is perceived to cause considerable obstacles to accessible eye care services across the country. In light of this, both the Indian and Nepal governments have put forward propositions for a primary and secondary eye care integration model that emphasizes the establishment of proper infrastructure and encourages public&#x02013;private partnerships (PPPs). This model aims to strengthen the accessibility and quality of eye care services, particularly in underserved rural areas where a majority of the populations in Southeast Asia reside and there is a much higher prevalence of vision impairment, fostering a more sustainable and inclusive approach to addressing the nation&#x02019;s eye care needs.</p><p>The experts believed that the biggest barriers to ensuring sustainable eye care delivery and positive patient outcomes in rural settings are retaining skilled surgeons,[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] lack of funding, infrastructure, patient awareness, and transportation.[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Yet, sustainable eye care delivery requires empowering the local population, local eye care providers, optometrists,[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and ophthalmologists[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with the necessary education and skills required to address the root causes of vision impairment and blindness through primary care that is ultimately initiated and sustained by the rural communities themselves. Sustainable eye care delivery would thus prompt us to consider laying the foundation for community eye care through providing affordable and sustainable technology, and resources, upskilling rural eye care providers, and educating the rural populations such that they would be able to sustain quality eye care in the long run without requiring external aid.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Proposal of a practical eye care delivery model</title><p>The surveyed experts considered that the six most important components for an effective eye care delivery model are awareness, accessibility, affordability, equality in quality, &#x0201c;closing the circle&#x0201d;, and sustainability.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Awareness:</italic> Patient awareness of health issues and the importance of seeking care is the first step in providing eye care delivery.

toggle="yes">Accessibility:</italic> One of the main reasons for the delayed presentation of patients in rural areas to tertiary eye care centers is accessibility challenges.[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Primary eye care services provided in makeshift vision camps or permanent vision centers in more peripheral rural areas must be backed by a tertiary center that provides surgery and required care for the patients [<xref rid="IJO.IJO_2196_23-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>].[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Primary eye care services in vision centers should be equipped with slit lamps and equipment necessary to minimize hospital visits and provide as many services as possible, such as screening and refraction services.[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Optometrists and ophthalmologists in secondary centers should be trained at the tertiary centers and provide specialty care to vision centers via the portal of telemedicine. Certain diagnostic equipment such as hand-held non-mydriatic fundus cameras equipped with visual acuity applications and sturdy autorefractometer could be installed in a van to work like a mobile eye clinic and further improve primary care access to patients.[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] For the PPP and integrated care model, experts suggested the establishment of more eye care clinics in underserved areas, along with the provision of mobile eye care units facilitated through joint investments and coordination under the PPP model. Similarly, they proposed integrating eye care services into existing primary healthcare centers and implementing telemedicine for remote diagnosis and consultation under the integration model.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Affordability:</italic> The socioeconomic status of patients in rural areas is generally quite poor, so in order for the majority of patients from outreach camps to receive care, their surgeries need to be subsidized.[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Therefore, it is crucial for eye care delivery models to have both paid and unpaid services. The paying patients essentially cover the cost of the services provided to unpaid patients, creating a self-sustaining hospital system. Implementing more government health insurance plans could also aid in increasing the affordability of eye care services. Also, structured partnerships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to support the funding requirements for centers operating in rural communities could be quite impactful. Experts emphasized the importance of offering subsidized or free eye care services through joint funding efforts and the establishment of special funding programs for underprivileged communities under the PPP model. They also stressed the significance of introducing comprehensive healthcare packages that include eye care services at subsidized rates within the general healthcare system and establishing community-based health insurance schemes like Ayushman Bharat under the integration model.[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>We propose an open-source robust technology platform&#x02014;healthcare management platform (HMP)&#x02014;to allow transparency in the entire ecosystem without any pilferages [<xref rid="IJO.IJO_2196_23-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>]. The proposed platform will allow (and should mandate) donors (including NGOs and govt organizations) to work with the possible partners/beneficiaries and that would hence establish accountability and credibility of both donors and beneficiaries.[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] At the same time, this platform should allow other management and clinical purposes such as data tracking, data auditing, self-assessment tools for vision assessment, tracking cataract surgery screening, and surgical outcomes and complications, in the end, serving as a human-chain supply distribution system (HCSDS) [<xref rid="APP3" ref-type="app">Appendix C</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="IJO.IJO_2196_23-F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Healthcare management platform for integrated community ophthalmology work&#x02014;a proposed model/platform for eyecare delivery in rural/semi-urban settings</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJO-72-473-g003" position="float"/></fig><p><italic toggle="yes">Equality in quality:</italic> Many current models of eye care delivery provide manual small incision cataract surgery and rigid intraocular lenses for all subsidized surgeries, and only provide phacoemulsification to paying patients.[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This should be standardized to allow all patients to receive the same surgery and lenses, depending on the grade of cataract[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and not based on socioeconomic status.[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] If not completely practical, stringent outcome analysis must be performed to ensure quality is not being compromised between the two patient demographics. All patients should be treated as regular patients and there should not be a discrepancy between junior and senior consultants operating on poor or rich patients. So long as the scoring systems and technical hierarchies in place for case distributions are equitable and only based on the difficulty of the case, this is acceptable. There should also be thorough training systems in place to ensure all surgeons have adequate surgical skills and are exposed to enough time in the operating theatre.[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Experts highlighted the need for standardized care through collaborative guidelines and protocols for both public and private eye care providers under the PPP model.

This is essential in maintaining the initial intention for quality eye care through treatment, without which many of the treatments provided would be futile and even counter-effective. Several strategies listed in <xref rid="IJO.IJO_2196_23-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> could be helpful in achieving this goal.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Sustainability:</italic> Funding is always a challenge for any institution, particularly for organizations in rural settings. Operation expenditures can be made to be self-sustaining through a model with both paying and non-paying patients. Continuous fundraising through corporate social responsibility and donors may be necessary to build peripheral centers and new hospitals. Increasing support and building trust from I-NGOs, N-NGOs, and other community financial supportive agencies is important, as they may prioritize the existing eye care delivery systems for collaboration and keep the newly emerging hospitals or smaller eye care delivery units on stand-by.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] One of the biggest challenges of establishing a hospital in rural areas is the sustainability of human resources and skilled doctors in these sorts of locations.[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Experts suggested formulating long-term sustainable funding models for the maintenance and expansion of eye care services through joint investment strategies under the PPP model. Similarly, they emphasized the importance of implementing training programs and capacity-building initiatives to ensure a sustainable workforce capable of meeting the growing demand for integrated eye care services under the integration model.</p><p>Besides developing a practical and robust model for eyecare delivery, experts believe social capital is a crucial component in generating community support and participation for joint awareness campaigns and rural community outreach programs, thus enhancing the dissemination of information about the importance of regular eye check-ups and overall eye care services to previously uninformed patients. Empowering patients and improving their social capital by teaching them about the factors that contribute to better health have the potential to transform patient lifestyles, reduce eye diseases, and benefit public health in these rural communities. Survey participants also emphasized the role of social capital in fostering partnerships and collaborations between different stakeholders, including government bodies, private institutions, and community-based organizations, to ensure the accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of eye care services in remote and underserved areas. Social capital was viewed as a catalyst for the mobilization of resources and the coordination of efforts to establish more eye care clinics and mobile units, particularly in areas with limited healthcare access.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, HCSDS-HMP modelled by the six components suggested by experts could be a solution for effective rural eye care delivery. These components include awareness, accessibility, affordability, equality in quality, closing the circle, and sustainability, and involve a series of concrete actions to be achieved. By implementing these measures and leveraging on social capital, we can strive toward a future where community care is not just a goal but a reality, positively impacting the lives of all individuals in the long run.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Authorship statement</title><p>ICMJE criteria were used for inclusion in the authors&#x02019; list.

<bold>Community Ophthalmology Perspective Survey V2</bold>
</p><p>A survey questionnaire to understand the intent, the need and the impact of community ophthalmology particularly in rural and peri-urban areas.</p><p>
<bold>Details about the survey:</bold>
</p><p>This survey based study aims to understand the current practices and global perspectives surrounding the intent, need, and impact of eye care services particularly in rural and peri-urban settings.</p><p>We define community ophthalmology using the WHO's definition of &#x0201c;the term used for the promotion and protection of eye health, and the provision of eye care, at the community level&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;is based on the concepts of public health ophthalmology, emphasizing particularly the interface between providers and consumers of eye care, and the empowering of communities to improve eye health&#x0201d;.</p><p>This survey aims to explore what we are currently doing to provide primary, secondary, and tertiary community eye care in rural and peri-urban areas, and what are the future directions needed to improve patient outcomes and implement sustainable eye care delivery systems in those areas.</p><p>Peri-urban areas are defined by UNESCO as &#x0201c;zones of transition from rural to urban land uses located between the outer limits of urban and regional centers and the rural environment.&#x0201d;</p><p>According to the WHO, primary level eye care involves community-based workers identifying and refering people with low vision to a higher level of service and advice on environmental modification. Secondary level eye care is at the district-level and involves assessing visual function, refraction testing, prescribing low-vision devices, and providing guidance on optical interventions and referring to tertiary services when appropriate. Tertiary level eye care involves a team of trained professionals offering advanced care in a highly developed eye clinic or hospital.</p><p>Through this survey, we hope to understand variance in practice patterns in different regions of the world, and determine what are some standard guidelines we can develop to help more people in the community and reduce blindness due to over-intervention. This would enable us to propose a revised and more practical model for eye care providers and policy makers to refer to while providing eye care services in rural and peri-urban areas in the future.</p><p>Please find here a <underline>list of references</underline> if you would like more literature about community ophthalmology.</p><p>All the experts (participants) should read the following before proceeding with the survey.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>You have been identified to participate in this study to assess your experience and perceptions of community ophthalmology in rural areas.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This may be administered as either an interview-based or online survey.

You will be acknowledged as an interview participant and expert in the introductory paragraph of the publication resulting from this survey.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All data collected will be solely used for the purpose of research and is not part of participants' standard clinical care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>By participating in this study, participants agree to allow all data provided to be used by the investigators and study team for research purposes.</p></list-item></list><p>

<bold>Appendix C2:</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Factors affecting the outcome of cataract surgery in rural settings</bold>
</p><p>Real world study to look into the factors resulting in poor post operative outcome following cataract surgery</p><p>
<bold>Introduction:</bold>
</p><p>Unaddressed cataract remains the most prevalent cause of moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness worldwide, affecting more than 94 million people globally. Particularly amongst the low and middle-income regions, the incidence of distance vision impairment is quadruple that of high-income regions. In India alone, the WHO/NPCB survey estimated a backlog of over 11 million blind people, of which an overwhelming 80.1% of these blindness are caused by cataract. Currently, cataract surgery remains the only definitive treatment of cataract-induced vision impairment. Nevertheless, many studies have reported poor visual outcomes amongst 30-40% of the patients who have undertaken cataract surgery, defined by poor visual acuities which are inadequate to meet the needs of daily activities. It is thus paramount to examine if patients are attaining the best possible visual outcomes after cataract surgery, and investigate the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors predisposing to poor visual outcomes post-surgery. We are hence conducting a real world observational study to explore the factors contributing to poor post operative visual outcome following a cataract surgery.</p><p>
<bold>Objectives:</bold>
</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To study and analyze the pre-op and intra-op factors affecting the outcome in patients undergoing cataract surgery in rural settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To validate the visual acuity and contrast sensitity application based on novel PocDoc platform.</p></list-item></list><p>
<bold>Rationale for the Study Population:</bold>
</p><p>The study includes a population recruited from the patients presenting to eye clinics at hospitals with cataract disease. Recruitment is regardless of participant's race, age and gender to obtain a demographic more representative of India's general population. The subjects will be recruited from eye clinics due to easy access to high patient load, with an appropriate setting to explain any risks and benefits of this study. Waiver of informed consent form will be obtained for this observational study.</p><p>
