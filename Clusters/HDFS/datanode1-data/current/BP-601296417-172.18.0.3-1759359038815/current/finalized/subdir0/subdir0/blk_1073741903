In Wolaita Zone, there was a lack of research on the myths, misconceptions, and elements linked to client satisfaction with family planning. This study aimed to assess the myths and misconceptions of family planning and the factors associated with women's satisfaction with family planning services.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used a mixed methods study design (cross-sectional study design with a phenomenological design of the qualitative study). For the survey, 777 women were selected using multistage sampling, while purposive sampling was used to recruit in-depth interview participants. We used STATA version 15 and NVIVO version 12 software.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Only two-thirds, 534 (68.7&#x000a0;%) [95&#x000a0;% CI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;65.4%&#x02013;71&#x000a0;%] clients, were satisfied with the family planning service.

Globally, the proportion of women of reproductive age who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods increased slightly, from 74&#x000a0;% in 2000 to 76&#x000a0;% in 2019. The proportion of contraceptive utilization in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 36&#x000a0;% to 55&#x000a0;% [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. About 214 million women of reproductive age in developing countries who want to avoid pregnancy are not using a modern contraceptive method [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The total fertility rate in Ethiopia is 4.6 children per woman, and 22&#x000a0;% percent of currently married women have an unmet need for family planning [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">In Ethiopia and the study area, contraceptive methods are free and made accessible to the household level through the health extension program. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health planned to increase the contraceptive prevalence rate to 66&#x000a0;% by 2015 [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which was not achieved nationally and in the study area [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ethiopia has committed to increasing the modern contraceptive prevalence rate to 55 % amongst married women by 2020, reducing the total fertility rate to 3.0, increasing the number of skilled providers delivering high-quality contraceptive services, and ensuring access for all populations [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, the 2023&#x02013;2030 Family Planning Casted Implementation Plan (FP&#x02013;CIP) is in line with the Health Sector Transformation Plan (HSTP-II) objective, which is to decrease the unmet need for FP from 22&#x000a0;% to 17&#x000a0;% by 2030 and raise the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) among married women (MW) from 41 percent to 54 percent [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

In Ethiopia, there is limited information on the myths, misconceptions, and client satisfaction with family planning services, particularly in southern Ethiopia.

The Zone is located 380&#x000a0;km south of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. It is structured into 16 districts and six town administrations; the administrative centre of the Zone is Sodo Town. With an area of 4208.64 square kilometres, Wolaita has a population density of 356.67. Five public hospitals, two private hospitals, 68 health centres, and other private health facilities deliver family planning services to the population in the Zone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Study design and period</title><p id="p0040">We used a mixed methods study design (facility-based cross-sectional study and a phenomenological qualitative study design) from 02 January to February 02, 2021.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Population and sampling</title><p id="p0045">The source populations for the quantitative study were all women aged 15&#x02013;49 years and residing in the Wolaita zone. Women aged 15&#x02013;49 years who use family planning services in the Wolaita Zone were included in the study. First-time and repeat users of family planning were included in the study, whereas women with disabilities that make interview/response difficult, such as hearing and speech disabilities, and women who are seriously ill were excluded. For the qualitative part, women participants were selected purposely based on their age 15&#x02013;49, and previous history of utilizing family planning for more than one year. Moreover, we purposely selected healthcare workers directly involved in family planning service provision for over two years.</p><p id="p0050">For the quantitative study, we calculated a sample size of 777 with the following assumptions: 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI), 5&#x000a0;% margin of error, 80&#x000a0;% power, an estimated client satisfaction proportion of 66.1&#x000a0;% [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a design effect of 2, and 10&#x000a0;% non-response rate. There are 22 districts (16 districts in rural and 6 town administrations in urban) in the Wolaita Zone. Sixty-eight health centres and seven hospitals in all communities provide family planning services. The districts were stratified into rural and urban areas. Thirty percent of the districts (five from rural and two from urban town administrations) were selected randomly. From the selected communities and town administrations, 11 health centres and one hospital (one-third of the health facilities) were selected randomly. The sample size was allocated to each selected facility based on the probability proportional to the last three months' case flow of the facilities in the Zone. Finally, all eligible women were recruited consecutively until sub-samples for the facilities and the total sample size for the study were achieved. For the qualitative research, sixteen in-depth interviews were held until saturation of ideas was attained.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Variables</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Outcome</title><p id="p0055">Client satisfaction: Fifteen Likert scale questions were asked to assess client satisfaction in family planning services: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree.

In order to maintain the tool's internal consistency and determine the reliability of the test, we used Cronbach's Alpha (0.7 and higher). Data collectors and supervisors were recruited and trained on different questionnaire modules, participants' selection, and ethics for two days. The questionnaire was pretested on five % of the sample size in health facilities, which were later not included in the main study. Data were collected using Open Data Kit (ODK) software version 1.9.0. Close supervision was carried out during data collection, and the principal investigator and other research team members monitored the overall data quality.</p><p id="p0085">The qualitative study used a semi-structured questionnaire with further probing questions.

We provided the participants' perspectives, and we undertook peer debriefing after each of the interviews. Moreover, to ensure transferability, we provided thick descriptions to let other readers criticize whether the findings were transferable to their context. To ensure dependability, we let our analysis be grounded in the data. Confirmability was also ensured by applying the audit trail (the researcher maintained detailed procedural records of the research process).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><label>3.5</label><title>Data management and analysis</title><p id="p0095">Data collected using ODK software was exported to Stata version 15.0 for analyses. Normality was checked for all continuous variables. Hosmer-Lemeshow's good-of-fit and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) tests were conducted to have confidence in the regression model. The ROC curve result showed outstanding discrimination with the area under the ROC curve&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.9013. We used binary logistic regression to identify exposure variables associated with the outcome variable. Exposures and covariates with p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.25 during the bivariate analysis were included in multivariable analysis to increase the model's power. Multivariate analysis was carried out to control for potential confounders and identify independent predictors of the outcome variable using a stepwise regression method. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) was reported. The level of significance was set at p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05.</p><p id="p0100">For the qualitative study, we used thematic analysis, employing the following six steps. First, familiarisation; to become familiar with the data, all interviews were transcribed verbatim and translated into English. The transcripts were read again to obtain the concepts or codes of a particular sentence or paragraph. We also transcribed the audio, read the text, took our first notes, and looked through it. Secondly, coding: The coding was carried out by four research teams, including the principal investigator, while interviews were done with the research team and research assistants. The sentences, words, or phrases that best describe the chosen topic were highlighted in portions of the sentences. Each code describes the concept or emotion made clear in that passage of text. We continued to add sentences and phrases while highlighting all the ones that meet these codes. We maintained bracketing, which means the codes generated were not based on the subjective opinion of the coder. In step three, we generated themes. Then, codes were categorized into the emerged themes. NVIVO version 12 software was used to assist data organization and analysis. We now reviewed the codes we've produced, looked for commonalities, and begun developing themes. A single theme was typically created by combining many codes. In the fourth step, we reviewed the themes and compared them to the data set. Defining and naming topics was step five. Writing up is step six. We put up our data analysis at the end.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Socio-demographic characteristics of respondents</title><p id="p0105">We successfully interviewed 777 Family Planning users after they had received care in twelve [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] public health facilities and made a response rate of 100&#x000a0;%.

We observed a lesser prevalence in the current study as compared to other studies in Mexico (81.3&#x000a0;%), Jordan (83&#x000a0;%), and Senegal (84&#x000a0;%) [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. It was also lower than similar study findings from Ethiopia (75.3&#x000a0;%), Mozambique (86&#x000a0;%), and Tanzania (91&#x000a0;%) [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>]. The main possible reason for the variation was that most of the above studies measured satisfaction using a single question, a subjective measure. In contrast, we used a composite score to measure satisfaction. Moreover, our qualitative study identified various myths and misconceptions regarding family planning, which reduce client satisfaction. Similarly, our qualitative finding shows that fear about their health, fear of losing sexual interest, medication adherence, husbands' refusal, and health care workers' refusal to remove the method before the due date were some of the reasons that might decrease client family planning satisfaction. Conversely, we found a higher prevalence of satisfaction compared to other studies in Eastern (41.7&#x000a0;%) and Central Ethiopia (62.6&#x000a0;%) [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This could be due to the lower quality of service provided. A comparable prevalence was reported in a study in northwest Ethiopia (66.1&#x000a0;%) [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p id="p0305">Like other study findings, a higher educational status was documented to positively predict satisfaction with family planning services. The current result agrees with a study in south Ethiopia, which might be homogeneous in many aspects of our settings, and a study from Iran [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The possible reason could be that women with higher educational status have a higher level of knowledge about contraceptives, leading to better satisfaction. Another possible explanation is that service providers are more likely to give detailed information on contraceptives to educated women than the uneducated, hoping they will understand what they have been told.</p><p id="p0310">In consistency with similar studies from Mexico, Senegal, and Ethiopia, and Kenya clients who didn't wait to get family planning services had much higher odds of being satisfied as compared to those who had waited for half an hour or more [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The facilities' low client flow and better service delivery process are the most possible reasons. It might also be due to the long working hours of the family planning clinics, with staff covering 24&#x000a0;h and seven days a week.</p><p id="p0315">In favour of our findings, studies from south and northwest Ethiopia revealed an increased chance of client satisfaction for family planning clinics with convenient working hours [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This might be because having convenient working hours will enable women to utilize the service at any time that is comfortable for them, especially the employed women who can utilize it outside their official working hours.</p><p id="p0320">Clients who were comfortable with the cleanliness of the clinic had higher odds of satisfaction with the family planning service. Similarly, a study conducted in Dosso Region, Niger, showed that the cleanliness of the clinic was one of the important drivers of the dimensions contributing to client satisfaction [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p id="p0325">. Moreover, the current finding agrees with similar studies from Ethiopia and elsewhere [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p id="p0330">In this study, clients whose Privacy was ensured were more likely to be satisfied with the family planning service. This finding is consistent with other similar studies from Hossana (south Ethiopia), Bahir Dar (northwest Ethiopia), and Kenya [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This might imply that family planning is a personal subject and clients require Privacy to discuss their problems openly. They will feel comfortable when their Privacy is secured. Lack of privacy can make it difficult for clients to actively utilize a family planning method.</p><p id="p0335">Clients who had been given explanations about the side effects of family planning methods and how to use the method had much higher odds of satisfaction. This finding agrees with other studies in Southern and Eastern Ethiopia [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These might be due to the provision of proper information and providers&#x02019; good counselling skills boosted satisfaction. Different from this finding, a study from Senegal reported that clients who had been told about side effects were less likely to be satisfied [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The possible reason for this difference might be the lack of effective counselling, which discouraged clients as they were told of the problems they may face using the method.</p><p id="p0340">Clients whose blood pressure has been measured and facilities with posters in the waiting room had a higher chance of satisfaction. These findings have not been reported in other studies, and we recommend further studies to evaluate the association between clients' satisfaction with family planning services and the measurement of blood pressure and having posters in the clinic's waiting area.</p><p id="p0345">The qualitative study explored the myths and misconceptions that hinder contraceptive utilization. Even though most respondents have good knowledge about modern contraceptive methods, myths and misconceptions are widespread in the study area.</p><p id="p0350">Side effects and other health-related concerns like dizziness, headache, decrease in sexual desire, abortion, and temporary infertility were mentioned by the participants as barriers to contraceptive utilization. Studies conducted in Kenya, India and Nepal reported similar findings [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Change in body weight was also mentioned as another side effect of contraceptives. Both weight gain and weight loss were reported using different methods. Similarly, a study from Turkey reported weight gain with the use of OCP, and weight loss was reported with IUCD use in India [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p id="p0355">Contrary to these, another study conducted in Ghana reported that women misinterpret weight change that occurs naturally in life with contraceptive use [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similarly, the use of a hormonal method (implanon) may lead to a broad variability in weight changes. For instance, a study conducted in JOS, Nigeria, on Implanon showed that its use may increase the average 2.5&#x000a0;kg rise in body weight during the investigation. There was, however, a wide range in each person's change in body weight, with 38.6&#x000a0;% either gaining weight or not changing at all. Sixteen percent of the women (61.4&#x000a0;%) saw a net weight gain while using Implanon(34). Our study participants reported that the use of IUCD is associated with cancer. This finding is supported by studies from Southern Ethiopia and Ghana [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p id="p0360">The current study identified various reasons that hinder women from family planning service utilization like a belief that family planning should be given to women with better socio-economic status who can get enough food, rumours, fear about their health, fear of losing sexual interest, medication adherence, husbands' refusal, health care workers' refusal to remove the method before the due date, violating clients informed choice, and forcing them to choose other methods. Similarly, method-related health concerns or side effects were found to be the second most common reason for contraceptive discontinuation and non-use in Ethiopia [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to reducing the utilization of contraceptives, the myths and misconceptions might even decrease satisfaction with service quality.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Study limitations</title><p id="p0365">In the cross-sectional study, this study couldn't establish the temporal relationship between the cause and effect. Another limitation is that since the interview was conducted with clients who visited the facility, we couldn't capture the perspective of most users at the lower-level facility (the health post level). Moreover, another limitation was that we didn't look at the supply side to understand some of the reasons for the low level of satisfaction. However, we used mixed methods design to understand misconceptions, and all other barriers hindering the utilization of family planning services can be mentioned as a strength of this research.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><label>7</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0370">This study used quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate client satisfaction, their feelings, and perception of myths and misconceptions within a community as a strength. Accordingly, this study identified low client satisfaction with family planning; only two-thirds were satisfied with the service delivered. Myths and misconceptions about family planning in Wolaita Zone also spread widely in the community. Higher levels of educational status of clients, ensuring privacy, having adequate information, measuring blood pressure, making working hours convenient for clients, not waiting for service, and cleanliness of the clinic were factors positively associated with client satisfaction and family planning. Moreover, the analysis of the qualitative study identified three themes regarding myths and misconceptions. &#x0201c;Various reasons why community members don't use family planning, myths, and misconceptions of family planning, and proposed enhancing factors in halting myths.</p><p id="p0375">Though it might not be possible to bring all childbearing or potential women with less school education, alternative opportunities for empowering women could be done. Client privacy should also be maintained during the consultation. Adequate information should be provided to clients on different aspects of family planning, particularly how to use the method and side effects. Organizational aspects like waiting time, working hours, and cleanliness should be improved. Besides, we recommend further studies on the association of blood pressure measurement and having posters in the clinic's waiting area to clients' satisfaction. Involving male and religious leaders in family planning programs, enhancing awareness among both husband and wife, improving the provider approach that suits on-site advocacy, and improving the quality of counselling during the family planning service provision were the critical interventions to minimize the myths and misconceptions.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="p0380">This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wolaita Sodo University, Ethiopia, with the approval number REF.
