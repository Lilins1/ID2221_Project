It is characterized by disruption of the cornea’s normal avascularity from the invasion of abnormal blood vessels in the stroma [ ]. These atypical vessels have increased vascular permeability and can cause chronic corneal edema, lipid and protein exudation, and scar formation leading to disarrangement of the regularly arranged lamellar collagen in the cornea. The loss of transparency can lead to visual impairment and blindness in severe cases. With an estimated annual incidence of 1.4 million people, CoNV represents a significant public health concern.[ ]\n\nUnfortunately, despite its prevalence, no curative therapy is available for this condition. Various treatments including anti-inflammatory agents, immunomodulatory drugs, fine needle diathermy (FND), and laser photocoagulation have been proposed to mitigate CoNV. However, these treatments often have limited effectiveness and may be associated with adverse effects. More recently, the introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs has provided new therapeutic options. There is also growing interest in combining different treatment modalities in a synergistic manner to enhance the management of CoNV. This review aims to provide an overview of the existing treatment options for CoNV and shed light on emerging therapeutic approaches for this debilitating condition."}

{"pmc_id":"PMC467016","category":["Review Article"],"title":{"_VALUE":["Molecular genetics of inherited normal tension glaucoma"]},"authors":["Pan, Yang","Iwata, Takeshi"],"body_text":"Glaucoma is a major optic neuropathy characterized by optic nerve damage and notable retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.[ ] Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) represents the most common type of glaucoma.[ ] The Baltimore Eye Survey reported that more than half of POAG patients do not exhibit elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), defining the case for normal tension glaucoma (NTG).[ ] NTG displays optic nerve head (ONH) damage, progressive retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, distinct visual field defects, open anterior chamber angles upon gonioscopy, and maintains an IOP below 21 mmHg without affecting the rest of the retina.[ ]\n\nEpidemiologic studies have identified several risk factors associated with NTG, including age, gender, ethnicity, and family history.[ ] First, the average age of NTG patients is in their 60s, generally older than individuals with POAG.[ ] Second, some studies have indicated a higher prevalence of NTG among females than males.[ ] However, this gender difference may be attributed to the longer life expectancy of females. Third, the incidence of NTG varies among different populations. Notably, research has shown a higher NTG prevalence in Asians (52%–92%), notably Japanese individuals (92%), compared to those of White ethnicity (30%–39%).[ ] In addition, Asian Americans have been found to have a 159% increased risk of NTG compared to non-Hispanic White individuals,[ ] possibly reflecting an increased demographic association and genetic susceptibility. Moreover, approximately 21% of NTG patients have a family history of glaucoma,[ ] further suggesting a genetic predisposition.\n\nWhile most forms of glaucoma have a hereditary component, they exhibit different patterns of inheritance. Glaucoma can occur at all ages, with Mendelian inheritance typical for the early-onset familial NTG and juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) and complex traits evident in adult-onset POAG and primary angle-closure glaucoma.[ ] Notably, gene mutations associated with early-onset glaucoma have significant biological effects, while variants contributing to adult-onset glaucoma typically have more minor effects.[ ]\n\nTo date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified the genomic loci for POAG.[ ] A recent multiethnic meta-analysis, encompassing 34,179 cases and 349,321 controls (NTG: 3247 cases, 47,997 controls; High-tension glaucoma (HTG): 5144 cases, 47,997 controls), identified 127 loci.[ ] All NTG loci, except rs1812974 near , showed nominal associations with HTG.[ ] In contrast to GWAS, which generally focuses on the common variants with smaller effects (minor allele frequency >1%), NTG pedigree studies have revealed rare mutations in four genes, most of which have been validated through and animal models.[ ] Numerous large NTG pedigrees have been described, typically demonstrating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, suggesting a Mendelian form of glaucoma caused by mutation in a single gene. This review examines the genetic role in NTG, drawing insights from PubMed studies published between January 1990 and December 2023. It delves into rare mutations identified through NTG pedigree studies, exploring pedigree characteristics, clinical features, protein function, mutation effects, and relevant animal models. The insights gained from these discoveries provide new perspectives on the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying glaucoma, potentially paving the way for novel gene-based therapies and neuroprotection strategies. Furthermore, gene-based diagnostic testing for mutations responsible for NTG promises to detect individuals in the earliest stages of the disease when therapeutic interventions are more effective."}
