Although the pterygium’s head is firmly attached to the cornea, its body is loosely attached to the bulbar conjunctiva.\n\nThe pathogenesis of pterygium has yet to be fully elucidated. The main etiological factor for pterygium development is ultraviolet light,[ ] and the prevalence of pterygium increases toward the equator. The other causative factors suspected in the pathogenesis of pterygium include human papillomavirus infection, inflammation, chronic irritation, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and genetics.[ ] Pterygium tissue resembles tumoral tissues in that it invades the cornea, recurs after resection, and exhibits cell proliferation. With the progression of pterygium, patients develop foreign body sensation, redness and itching due to inflammation, blurred vision, and astigmatism due to its progression to the corneal surface toward the optic axis.[ ]\n\nSurgical excision is the preferred treatment model for pterygium.[ ] The bare sclera technique used in the past is no longer preferred because of its high recurrence rate. Conjunctival autograft, limbal autograft, amniotic membrane graft, and the use of antifibrotic agents are the preferred methods of treatment.[ ]\n\nCD44 (phagocytic glycoprotein-1) is a member of a family of non-kinase, structurally changeable, and multifunctional transmembrane glycoproteins that are expressed to various extents in other cell types, including embryological stem cells, connective tissues, and bone marrow.[ ] CD44 is involved in the organization of certain cellular processes, for instance, cell adhesion, division, and migration, by binding with its main ligand, hyaluronic acid.[ ]\n\nProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a proliferation marker in the nucleus. PCNA plays a very important role in DNA synthesis, repair, and cell cycle regulation.[ ] It is used as a proliferation marker in some cancer types.[ ]\n\nE-cadherin is a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the protection of tissue integrity and cell-to-cell adhesion.[ ] E-cadherin functions as a tumor suppressor protein by regulating cell activities.[ ] Reduced expression of E-cadherin in many cancer types correlates with poor prognosis and the potential for metastasis.[ ]\n\nThe present study aimed to investigate the expression patterns of CD44, PCNA, and E-cadherin in both control conjunctiva and pterygium tissue."}

It can detect and quantify vision loss even when visual acuity is normal.[ ] Loss of contrast sensitivity can lead to visual difficulties and may predict performance impairment compared to standard acuity measurements.[ ]\n\nContrast sensitivity assessment is different from visual acuity testing in that it uses targets with varying contrast levels instead of targets that vary in size but have a single high level of contrast.[ ] The subject must distinguish between visible and invisible increments of luminance from the background.[ ] Contrast sensitivity assessment serves as a valuable tool for early detection of issues related to the optic nerve, irregularities in the eye’s media, and macular lesions.[ ] However, interpreting the data from contrast sensitivity tests is more intricate compared to visual acuity data, especially when it comes to distinguishing subtle abnormalities from what is considered a normal presentation.[ ]\n\nThere are two primary types of contrast sensitivity tests: grating tests and letter tests.[ ] In clinical settings, the Pelli-Robson chart is a widely used tool for letter testing. It consists of eight rows of letters, each row containing two sets of three letters, with contrast levels varying among these groups of letters.[ ] Each letter on the Pelli-Robson chart subtends a visual angle of 2.86 degree when viewed from a distance of 1 meter. The Pelli-Robson score quantifies a subject’s contrast sensitivity on a logarithmic scale, ranging from 0 to 2.25. The original scoring system grants 0.15 credit if at least two out of three letters in a set are correctly identified, while a modified scoring system grants 0.05 credit per correctly identified letter.[ ]\n\nThe Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity test is considered a reliable test with good test-retest repeatability. This chart can maintain its reliability across various factors such as background luminance within the photopic range, testing distances spanning from 0.25 to 4 meters, and even when there is a 2-D defocus due to the large letters on the chart. However, it does come with some logistical limitations due to its wall-mounted design, bulky size, and the chart’s tendency to fade over time.[ ]\n\nThe LEA contrast sensitivity chart is another letter test used in clinical practice in recent years. It is available in two formats: the LEA symbol chart and the LEA number chart. The chart is available in the form of flip cards, but the letter subtends a different angle for different distances. The LEA chart has five pages with five numbers or five symbols on each page, with contrast ranging from 25% to 1.2%.[ ]\n\nWhile the LEA contrast sensitivity chart offers a reliable test in a way more practical and portable chart,[ ] another study reported that the LEA chart is less reliable and has relatively less test-retest repeatability compared to Pelli-Robson.[ ] This condition led to a question of whether we can predict the Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity score based on the LEA contrast sensitivity score. This study aimed to develop a conversion method to facilitate the transition from the LEA to the Pelli-Robson and validate the conversion score."}
