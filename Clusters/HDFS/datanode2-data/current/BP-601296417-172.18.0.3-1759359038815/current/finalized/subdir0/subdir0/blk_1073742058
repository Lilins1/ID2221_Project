Three- or four-handed manipulations are usually required, yet maneuverability is usually limited by the single nare, thus an adjunctive corridor for an assistant is valuable. Most techniques prefer a combined septectomy for medial mass resection[ ] and a combined transmaxillary approach for inferior mass resection.[ ] Here, we introduce two cases to illustrate a simple improvement for the transseptal technique. Specifically, our goal was to facilitate instrument maneuverability, especially for orbital cavernous venous malformation (CVM), one of the most common benign intraorbital malformations in adults. The advantages of this technique include its being minimally invasive and maintaining septal integrity, while greatly improving operation efficiency."}

A shallow anterior chamber prevents recoil of the tissue into a scroll as fluid currents induced by tapping the corneal surface unfurl the tissue. In an optimally shallow chamber, the iris plane bulges anteriorly towards the cornea due to posterior pressure, which in turn renders the anterior surface of the DMEK scroll immediately subjacent to and in partial contact with the overlying posterior surface of the cornea; the DMEK scroll’s posterior surface sits on the iris plane. The iris and overlying cornea’s mechanism of action for preventing re-scrolling of the DMEK tissue is by exerting frictional forces that counteract the tissue’s intrinsic recoil forces. Tapping the cornea in the setting of an optimally shallow anterior chamber results in a DMEK scroll progressively unfurling without re-scrolling. In a chamber that is too shallow or nearly absent, there is excessive contact between the iris, DMEK scroll, and overlying cornea such that the frictional forces exerted on the scroll pin the leaflets into a stationary position. Tapping the cornea in the setting of a flat anterior chamber does not result in any movement of the scroll’s leaflets. By contrast, in a chamber that is too deep, there is insufficient contact between the iris, DMEK scroll, and overlying cornea such that the recoil forces of the scroll are unopposed. Tapping the cornea in the setting of a deep anterior chamber results in unfurling movements of the scroll that are immediately followed by recoiling movements, resulting in a DMEK tissue that begins to open but does not remain open. Titrating the anterior chamber to the optimal shallowness – and avoiding a flat or deep anterior chamber – rests with the surgeon’s judgment and continual attention as he adds and removes fluid during the unscrolling process.\n\nHowever, the propensity of an anterior chamber to shallow sufficiently will always hinge on the eye’s posterior pressure or lack thereof. In the presence of some comorbidities, chamber shallowing can be difficult, if not impossible. For example, eyes that are post-vitrectomy lack the posterior pressure necessary to achieve sufficient and durable chamber shallowing.[ ] However, even eyes with intact vitreous bodies can be difficult to shallow in certain conditions, such as axial myopia, vitreous syneresis, penetrating keratoplasty, and glaucoma shunts. In such circumstances, experienced surgeons have described how to augment the eye’s posterior pressure by indenting the bulbar surface with a finger or surgical instrument.[ ] But because one hand is tasked with executing two movements at once, this approach requires an assistant or modification of one’s preferred two-cannula technique (such as the highly effective Dirisamer technique).\n\nWe describe a hands-free method for augmenting posterior pressure, when needed, by placing self-retained cellulose sponges between the bulbar surface and the eyelid speculum."}
