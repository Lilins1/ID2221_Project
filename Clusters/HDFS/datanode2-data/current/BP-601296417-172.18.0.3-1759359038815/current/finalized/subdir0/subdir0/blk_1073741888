The main cause of visual loss and impairment in diabetic patients is macular edema. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is characterized by the presence of exudation and accumulation of extracellular fluid in the retinal layers, which are caused by an increase in the permeability of retinal blood vessels.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The current treatment of choice in central DME is intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), steroid implant injections, and subthreshold micropulse laser. Awareness of the role of VEGF and inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of DME has prompted the development and widespread use of intravitreal steroid and anti-VEGF inhibitors that can target these pathways.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Intravitreal ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept are the most commonly used anti-VEGF treatments for DME. There are three different synthetic preparations including triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetate, and dexamethasone implant for intravitreal corticosteroid administration.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Clinical trials remain the most effective form of evaluation of the effects of treatment, yet their selection criteria limit the recruitment of patients in upper or lower age ranges or suffering from multiple comorbidities. It should also be kept in mind that patients in clinical trials may behave differently than real-life patients and the risk of bias cannot be completely avoided in practice. Real-life studies are qualified to remedy these limitations. They examine patients according to their real-life behaviors and aim to minimize the differences and biases due to patient or physician behavior. There are few real-life studies in the literature investigating the effectiveness of intravitreal injections in DME. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety profile of intravitreal aflibercept, dexamethasone, and ranibizumab in treatment-naive patients with DME in daily clinical practice.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>This retrospective study was conducted upon the approval of the institutional ethical committee and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The participants were treatment-naive adult diabetic patients who had intravitreal anti-VEGF or dexamethasone implant injections for DME with a regular follow-up of a minimum of 12 months. Exclusion criteria were concomitant retinal diseases, focal/grid laser in the last 3 months, and intraocular surgery within the study period or &#x02264;6 months before study inclusion.</p><p>The selection of the intravitreal drug was made by the physician according to the physician&#x02019;s own criteria. In general, anti-VEGF agents were the treatment of choice; however, they were not preferred in patients with a history of stroke or heart attack &#x02264;3 months before treatment. Steroid implants were mostly preferred in patients with a history of stroke or heart attack &#x02264;3 months before the treatment and in eyes with inflammatory findings on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, such as hyperreflective dots, chronicity findings, and diffuse and severe macular edema. Patients&#x02019; requests for not having injections on a monthly basis, having glaucoma, and a history of vitrectomy were also taken into consideration while taking the decision for treatment.</p><p>Information about age, gender, history of eye surgery, duration of diabetes, diabetic treatment, comorbidity, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value was obtained from the hospital database.</p><p>All patients initially underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), central retinal thickness (CRT), and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). BCVA was evaluated by the Snellen chart and converted into log of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) for statistical evaluations. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT; Spectralis/HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) was used for detecting macular edema and measurement of CRT. In our study, FFA-based DME classification was divided into three types according to the leakage pattern as defined by Kang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These are focal leakage type with well-circumscribed focal leakage areas from microaneurysms, diffuse type with large leak areas that are not well limited around the fovea, and diffuse cystoid type with fluorescein leakage in the cystoid spaces in the late period.</p><p>A single-dose injection was administered to the dexamethasone group at the beginning of the treatment. Ranibizumab and aflibercept groups were given three consecutive doses at 1-month intervals. Patients were monitored every 4 weeks with IOP, BCVA, CRT measurements and fundus examination. A decreased BCVA and/or foveal-involving intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid and/or CRT &#x0003e;250 &#x000b5;m were indications for retreatment. Two subgroup analyses were performed as those with BCVA values 0.4 logMAR and above (poor visual acuity) and those with BCVA values below 0.4 logMAR (good visual acuity) based on the Protocol T study.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) statistical software (SPSS 11.0.0 for MS Windows; SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test was used for the determination of the distribution of the data. Parametric tests were used for the comparison of homogenously distributed data, whereas nonparametric tests were used for the comparison of nonhomogenously distributed data. Categorical variables were compared with the Chi-square test. A <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>The records of 524 patients (including 863 eyes) having treatment for DME were screened.

In this real-world design study, we found that ranibizumab and aflibercept significantly increased visual acuity by three loading doses followed by the pro re nata (PRN) regimen, whereas dexamethasone, which was injected at baseline and repeated as needed during the follow-up, did not improve visual acuity significantly at the 12-month visit in treatment-naive DME patients. CRT significantly decreased in all groups at the 12-month visit. When classified as having poor and good initial visual acuity, there was no significant difference in BCVA between the treatment groups in the former, whereas ranibizumab was superior to dexamethasone with no significant difference between ranibizumab and aflibercept in the latter. There were no serious complications in the treatment groups.</p><p>Although many studies have compared the efficacy of anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of naive DME, only a few studies have compared intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGF treatments. In the study INVICTUS, which is a real-life study comparing ranibizumab, aflibercept, and dexamethasone, anatomical and functional efficacy was reported in all groups. BCVA improved significantly to 69.6 &#x000b1; 12 letters (+7.2 letters) at 12 months for the ranibizumab group and to 67.5 &#x000b1; 12.2 letters (+8.5 letters) at 12 months for the aflibercept group. For the dexamethasone group, BCVA improved to 68.4 &#x000b1; 11.2 letters (+9.4 letters) at 12 months. Similar to our study, the PRN regimen treatment was applied for anti-VEGF agents after a 3-month loading phase, and reinjection was administered to patients treated with dexamethasone, without time limitation, in worsening BCVA and/or increase in CRT. This study had a smaller sample size than our study; 19 eyes were treated with ranibizumab, 20 eyes with aflibercept, and 21 eyes with dexamethasone, a total of 60 eyes.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Unlike our study, it was predicted that there was an improvement in BCVA due to the higher mean number of injections in the dexamethasone group and a statistically significant decrease in CRT.</p><p>In the study MAGGIORE, a multicenter (12 countries, 60 centers), open-label, randomized, parallel-group, noninferiority study comparing ranibizumab and dexamethasone, 181 patients in the dexamethasone group (55.8%; treatment naive) and 182 patients in the ranibizumab group (55.5%; treatment naive) were evaluated. The mean change from baseline CRT at 12 months was similar in the dexamethasone (DEX) implant and ranibizumab groups (&#x02212;173.9 and &#x02212;163.5 &#x003bc;m, respectively). The mean BCVA change from baseline at 12 months was found to be unequal (+7.6 letters and +4.34 letters, respectively). The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between groups was &#x02212; 4.74 to &#x02212; 1.88, with the lower bound of &#x02212;4.74 letters within the predefined, clinically relevant, noninferiority margin of 5 letters. Unlike our study, when FFA and fluorescent leaking areas at 12 months were compared to baseline, they reported that there were fewer leaks in the dexamethasone group at 12 months (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] They reported that the differences in BCVA outcomes between treatment groups may be due to the 5-month interval between dexamethasone implant treatments.</p><p>In our study, anatomical improvement was found with a change in CRT of -175.4 &#x000b5;m in the ranibizumab group, -153.3 &#x000b5;m in the aflibercept group, and -71.4 &#x000b5;m in the dexamethasone group at 12 months. At the end of a 1-year follow-up, the change in CRT was reported as -133.9 &#x000b5;m with ranibizumab treatment in the study of Patrao <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., -121 &#x000b5;m with aflibercept therapy in the study of Kern <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., -135 &#x000b5;m with dexamethasone treatment in BEVORDEX study, and -173.54 &#x000b5;m with dexamethasone treatment in the study of Chhablani <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In our study, the change in BCVA and CRT in the ranibizumab and aflibercept groups was consistent with the literature; however, in the dexamethasone group, poorer results were noted. The mean CRT change from baseline was statistically significantly greater in ranibizumab and aflibercept groups compared to that in the dexamethasone group at the sixth month, ninth month, and 12<sup>th</sup> month, whereas there was no statistically significant difference between ranibizumab and aflibercept. In addition, consistent with the previous studies, the peak effect after dexamethasone implant was observed approximately 3 months posttreatment.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the current studies conducted in clinical practice, treatment with the dexamethasone implant in DME patients resulted in visual acuity improvement, which was compatible with a decrease in retinal thickness.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our study, mean BCVA improved only at 3 months from baseline, consistent with the reduction in CRT in the dexamethasone group. There was a statistically significant difference from baseline at all time points in the ranibizumab and aflibercept groups. Baseline visual acuity in the ranibizumab (0.62 logMAR) and aflibercept (0.56 logMAR) groups was lower than that of the dexamethasone group (0.46 logMAR). This may have supported further gains in the anti-VEGF groups. In addition, limited visual gains in the dexamethasone group may have been related to the duration of macular edema, the limited amount of CRT change, and increased lens opacity and other inflammatory biomarkers. Another important issue to take into account is the difference in sample sizes, with the dexamethasone group being the smallest one including 33 eyes (15.06%).</p><p>Protocol T was the largest randomized clinical trial that compared aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in patients with DME. At the end of the first year, aflibercept seemed to be more efficient in terms of improving visual acuity and reducing CRT, especially in eyes with low BCVA, whereas there were no significant differences between the groups when the initial visual acuity loss was mild. At the end of the second year, the BCVA values did not significantly differ between the groups.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In our study, when classified according to initial visual acuity, those with poor visual acuity made up the majority and there was no significant difference in BCVA between the treatment groups at the end of the follow-up period. It is worth noting that the ranibizumab dose was 0.3 mg in the Protocol T study and 0.5 mg in our study, which might explain the difference in the findings between the studies. In eyes with good visual acuity, there was no statistically significant difference in BCVA between ranibizumab and aflibercept groups, whereas only the ranibizumab group was statistically significantly better than the dexamethasone group. In eyes with good visual acuity, the ratio of cataract development was higher in the dexamethasone group (25%) compared to the other groups (ranibizumab 12%, aflibercept 13%). On the other hand, in eyes with good visual acuity, the mean CRT value worsened at 12<sup>th</sup> month compared to baseline in the dexamethasone group, whereas an improvement was noted in the anti-VEGF groups. These findings suggest that both deterioration of macular edema and cataract development might play a role in limited visual gain in the dexamethasone group.</p><p>In this study, the patients were injected with monthly three loading doses of anti-VEGF agents; then, during 12 months of follow-up period, the anti-VEGF and dexamethasone implant were reinjected if the macular edema was still present. The ranibizumab group received a mean of 4.96 &#x000b1; 1.49 injections, the aflibercept group had a mean of 4.81 &#x000b1; 1.31 injections, and the dexamethasone group had a mean of 1.96 &#x000b1; 0.58 injections. The anti-VEGF groups showed significantly lower injection numbers compared to the dexamethasone group. This is explained by the release of active substances into the vitreous for up to 6 months by dexamethasone implants. Our injection numbers are lower than the real-world studies. After 12 months of follow-up, Fouda and Bahgat[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported 5.62 injections in the aflibercept group and 6.02 in the ranibizumab group, Plaza-Ramos <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported 5.56 injections in the ranibizumab group and 6.07 injections in the aflibercept group, whereas Matonti <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported 2.16 injections in the dexamethasone group. Since these findings reflect real-world conditions, the differences in findings might be due to delays in injection appointments secondary to patient noncompliance and the growing number of injection requirements over the constant and limited injection capacity of clinics.</p><p>While temporary and sudden IOP increase is a common complication after intravitreal injection, prolonged and continuous IOP elevation that requires medical or surgical intervention is rarely seen.[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In a retrospective study conducted to determine the IOP changes of patients treated with anti-VEGF treatment for DME, Al-Abdullah <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported 7% transient and 5.8% persistent IOP elevation in the mean 18-month follow-up period. Ozkaya <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that among patients receiving intravitreal dexamethasone for persistent DME, in the 1-year follow-up, 14% of patients had an increase in IOP of &#x02265; 10 mmHg and only 4% needed chronic antiglaucomatous medication. In our study, the frequency of increase in IOP after 1 year of follow-up was similar to that reported in literature. There was no statistically significant difference in IOP increase rates between groups. Medical treatment was successful in all patients, and no surgical treatment was required.</p><p>Cataract is another common complication of intravitreal injection. Cataract development was reported at 4.4% in the APOLLON study,[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] 22.2% in the PLACID study,[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 9.9% in a real-life study by Hodzic-Hadzibegovic <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] assessing the efficacy of 12-month treatment with ranibizumab in DME. In our study, cataract development rates were found to be similar compared to the literature. Serious complications such as retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, sudden vision loss, cerebrovascular disease, and myocardial infarction were not detected.</p><p>Limitations of the study include its retrospective design, small sample size, and practice biases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our real-world data indicates that significant anatomical improvement was achieved in all treatment groups in DME patients at the end of the first year. In terms of functional improvement, ranibizumab and aflibercept groups revealed a significant BCVA increase, whereas the dexamethasone group did not show a significant change in BCVA at the end of the first year. In eyes with poor vision, BCVA was not significantly different between groups throughout the follow-up period; however, in eyes with good vision, the ranibizumab group had better BCVA than in the dexamethasone group at month 12. No serious complications or significant increases in cataract and IOP were noted during the study period. Unlike in phase studies, our real-life study also reveals the possible consequences of the limited injection capacity compared to the growing number of patients requiring injection, as well as patient noncompliance issues. Finally, the current study is one of the rare real-life studies in the literature, which involves treatment-naive DME patients and documents the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab, aflibercept, and dexamethasone treatments. Future real-life studies with larger sample sizes might enable physicians and patients to establish better treatment protocols and set more realistic expectations.</p><sec sec-type="funding-statement" id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author">
