This study aimed to investigate the effects of ATX on podocytes in diabetic nephropathy and the underlying renal protective mechanism of ATX, which leads to pathological crosstalk with mesangial cells.<bold>Methods:</bold>&#x000a0;In this study, diabetic rats treated with ATX exhibited reduced 24-h urinary protein excretion and decreased blood glucose and lipid levels compared to vehicle-treated rats. Glomerular mesangial matrix expansion and renal tubular epithelial cell injury were also attenuated in ATX-treated diabetic rats compared to control rats.<bold>Results:</bold>&#x000a0;ATX treatment markedly reduced the &#x003b1;-SMA and collagen IV levels in the kidneys of diabetic rats. Additionally, ATX downregulated autophagy levels. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic>, compared with normal glucose, high glucose inhibited LC3-II expression and increased p62 expression, whereas ATX treatment reversed these changes. ATX treatment also inhibited &#x003b1;-SMA and collagen IV expression in cultured podocytes. Secreted factors (vascular endothelial growth factor B and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;) generated by high glucose-induced podocytes downregulated autophagy in human mesangial cells (HMCs); however, this downregulation was upregulated when podocytes were treated with ATX.<bold>Conclusions:</bold>&#x000a0;The current study revealed that ATX attenuates diabetes-induced kidney injury likely through the upregulation of autophagic activity in podocytes and its antifibrotic effects. Crosstalk between podocytes and HMCs can cause renal injury in diabetes, but ATX treatment reversed this phenomenon.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Astaxanthin</kwd><kwd>diabetic nephropathy</kwd><kwd>podocytes</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>crosstalk</kwd><kwd>mesangial cells</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

Currently, there are 100 million diabetic adults and 150 million prediabetic patients in China [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 120 million people in China [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The glomerulus is an early and important site of diabetic injury in the kidney. Glomerular hypertrophy, basement membrane thickening, capillary loop obliteration, and the loss of podocytes from the glomerular filtration barrier are hallmarks of progressive DN, and the degree of podocyte loss correlates with disease severity [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Progressive podocyte injury, characterized by low podocyte density and number, hypertrophy, and foot process effacement, plays a central role in the development of DN in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, podocyte damage is a key factor that can be used as a clinical predictor of DN progression. Mesangial cells are the primary cell type in the glomeruli. Abnormal activation of mesangial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Podocytes are connected by special intercellular junctions called septa and are separated from the endothelial lumen by the basement membrane of the glomerulus. For this structure to function, these cells must cross-communicate with each other. It has been reported that glomerular podocytes and endothelial cells, endothelial cells and mesangial cells, and podocytes and mesangial cells communicate with each other. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying glomerular cell crosstalk and feedback regulation in proteinuric glomerular diseases are poorly understood. In particular, direct <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> evidence of communication between podocytes and mesangial cells is scarce [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Currently, several signaling pathways, including those involving endothelin-1, chemokine C-C motif receptor 7 and its ligand SLC/CCL21, platelet-derived growth factor, connective tissue growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), have been suggested to be involved in this type of signaling [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent mass degradation process that is highly conserved from yeasts to mammals. Autophagy typically participates in the elimination of long-term aggregated and misfolded proteins, damaged and excessive organelles, and intracellular pathogens [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Autophagy is primarily responsible for the destruction of proteins and organelles after the regulation of cellular homeostasis and is considered to be an essential inducing factor of posttranslational damage [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Numerous signaling molecules are involved in autophagy. Studies have suggested that the alteration of nutrient-sensing pathways under diabetic conditions impairs the autophagic stress response, which may exacerbate organelle dysfunction and lead to DN development [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, autophagy represents a potential therapeutic target for treating DN caused by cell damage [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Astaxanthin (3,3&#x02032;-dihydroxy-B, B&#x02019;-carotenoids 4,4&#x02032;-dione, ATX) is called &#x02018;marine carotenoid&#x02019;, and ATX has stronger antioxidant activity than other carotenoids and relies on the quenching of free radicals. These compounds are widespread in marine organisms such as algae, crustaceans, salmon, prawns, and crabs [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous research has demonstrated that ATX protects against hepatic damage [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], neurological activity [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and cardiovascular damage [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. ATX also prevents oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, and apoptosis in patients with DM [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that ATX attenuates both lung and liver fibrosis [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the effect of ATX on renal fibrosis has not yet been explored, and it is unclear whether ATX can ameliorate renal fibrosis by regulating autophagy. In this study, streptozotocin (STZ) injection and a high-fat (HF) diet were used to induce renal fibrosis in DN rats <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>; these rats along with <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> high glucose-induced human podocytes were used to investigate the effect of ATX on renal fibrosis in DN and its potential protective mechanisms. Supernatant transfer experiments were also used to investigate how podocytes release signaling factors through autophagy to induce mesangial cell autophagy, which further improves renal fibrosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" disp-level="1" id="S0002"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2001"><label>2.1.</label><title>Materials</title><p>ATX was obtained from Shanghai Second Military Medical University.

Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured after 12&#x02009;h of fasting, and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) was measured 2&#x02009;h after a meal. Blood glucose levels were determined using One Touch Ultra test strips and a blood glucose meter (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson Medical Ltd., Shanghai, China).

Serum insulin levels were measured using a rat insulin ELISA kit (Qiaodu, Shanghai, China). Clinically, renal involvement in patients with diabetes is defined by the appearance of microalbuminuria at an early stage.

As displayed in <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, BW was significantly greater in the HF, HA, DM, and DA groups from the 1st - 15th weeks than in the normal group. At the end of the 15th week, the BW in the HA group was lower than that in the HF group, and the BW in the DA group was lower than that in the DM group. The 24-h urinary protein level was significantly greater in all groups than in the normal group. Moreover, the urinary protein levels in the DA group were lower than those in the DM group. Similarly, the urinary protein levels in the HA group were lower than those in the HF group (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> shows that in the OGTT, blood glucose in the normal group was lower than that in the HF, HA, DM and DA groups. However, compared to those in the HF and DM groups, the blood glucose levels in the HA and DA groups were lower. FBG and PBG levels were measured at the end of the study. The rats in the HF, DM, and DA groups had higher FBG and PBG levels than did those in the normal group. However, the FBG and PBG levels in the HA group were lower than those in the HF group, and the DA group had lower levels of FBG and PBG than did the DM group (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>). This finding could be because ATX effectively prevented an increase in serum glucose in the model group, showing that ATX effectively attenuated blood glucose levels in HF diet-fed and diabetic rats. As shown in <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, compared to those in the normal group, the HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, TG, BUN, and UA levels in the HF, HA, DM, and DA groups were significantly different. LDL-C, TC, TG, BUN, and UA levels were significantly increased, whereas HDL-C levels were significantly decreased. However, LDL-C, TC, BUN and UA levels were substantially lower in the DA group than in the DM group, and HDL-C levels were significantly increased. The LDL-C, TC, TG and UA levels in the HA group were significantly lower than those in the HF group, whereas the HDL-C level was significantly greater. These data indicate that oral ATX may decrease lipid metabolism as well as urea nitrogen and uric acid levels. As shown by the black arrow in the pathological staining figure, the glomeruli in the HF and DM groups were larger in volume, accompanied by tubular epithelial swelling. Renal injury was more severe in the DM group compared with the HF group. However, ATX treatment reversed this effect in the kidneys of HF and DM rats (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G, H</xref>). These findings suggested that ATX treatment has an antifibrotic effect on diabetic nephropathy.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="t0001"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Biochemical parameters for all rats at the end of the study.</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col width="80pt"/><col width="80pt"/><col width="80pt"/><col width="80pt"/><col width="80pt"/><col width="80pt"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center">N</th><th align="center">HF</th><th align="center">HA</th><th align="center">DM</th><th align="center">DA</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left">HDL-C (mmol/mL)</td><td align="char" char=".">1.71&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.10</td><td align="char" char=".">1.26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.58<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">1.41&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.10<sup>ab</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">1.14&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">1.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.04<sup>ac</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">LDL-C (mmol/mL)</td><td align="char" char=".">0.44&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.12</td><td align="char" char=".">0.67&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.14<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">0.60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03<sup>ab</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">0.74&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.07<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">0.59&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03<sup>ac</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">TC (mmol/mL)</td><td align="char" char=".">1.26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.12</td><td align="char" char=".">2.27&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.15<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">1.83&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.22<sup>ab</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">2.81&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.37<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">1.94&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.07<sup>ac</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">TG (mmol/mL)</td><td align="char" char=".">0.68&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.11</td><td align="char" char=".">3.33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.62<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">2.40&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.10<sup>ab</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">4.61&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.97<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">3.87&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.64<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">BUN (umol/L)</td><td align="char" char=".">3.90&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.91</td><td align="char" char=".">5.55&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.38<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">4.96&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.55<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">6.38&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">5.79&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.18<sup>ac</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">CREA (umol/L)</td><td align="char" char=".">19.33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.39</td><td align="char" char=".">22.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.10</td><td align="char" char=".">20.83&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.32</td><td align="char" char=".">22.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.38</td><td align="char" char=".">19.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.37</td></tr><tr><td align="left">UA (umol/L)</td><td align="char" char=".">73.83&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.00</td><td align="char" char=".">139.67&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17.22<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">119.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.72<sup>ab</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">203.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;28.81<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">142.17&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;25.62<sup>ac</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF1"><p>Results are presented as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6. <sup>a</sup><italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 compared with the normal group, <sup>b</sup><italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 compared with the HF group, <sup>c</sup><italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 compared with the DM group.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0003-S2002"><label>3.2.</label><title>Astaxanthin alleviated renal fibrosis in rats</title><p>Next, &#x003b1;-SMA and collagen IV mRNA and protein levels were evaluated in the renal tissues of rats in all experimental groups.

As shown in <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C&#x02013;G</xref>, compared to that in the P(Ctrl) group, autophagy in the HMCs was significantly decreased when the HMCs were incubated with the supernatant derived from podocytes treated with high glucose. Compared to that in the P(HG) group, HMC autophagy was significantly greater in the P(HG&#x02009;+&#x02009;ATX) group. Furthermore, compared to that in the P(HG) group, collagen IV protein expression was significantly lower in the P(HG&#x02009;+&#x02009;ATX) group. The <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> results of our study suggested that the diabetic microenvironment caused autophagy and fibrosis in HMCs, and this phenomenon could be ameliorated by ATX. These data also support the emerging notion that molecular signaling crosstalk exists between autophagic podocytes and mesangial cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" disp-level="1" id="S0004"><label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Nutritional strategies for treating fibrosis are currently a growing area of research, and several natural substances exhibit effective antifibrotic effects. Recent studies have indicated that ATX can reduce organ fibrosis, including fibrosis in the liver, heart, lungs, and kidneys, suggesting that ATX represents a promising treatment for fibrosis. The kidneys are particularly susceptible to the development of fibrotic damage, often as a result of chronic conditions such as unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and DN [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the effect of ATX on DN remains unclear. In this study, we found that &#x003b1;-SMA and collagen IV expression decreased in the kidneys of diabetic rats after ATX treatment. Similar results were observed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> in podocytes. Therefore, these results indicate that podocytes are the target cells of ATX.</p><p>Thus, the question of how ATX is regulated in DN fibrosis arises. Autophagy plays a central role in several diseases, including cancer, pathogenic infections, and metabolic diseases. Autophagy inducers are currently receiving considerable attention, as both the induction and inhibition of autophagy may be beneficial. LC3 has been proposed to be an indicator of self-phagocytosis. There are two types of LC3: LC3-I, which is generally present in the cytosol, and LC3-II, which is present in the membrane. LC3-II is an insoluble protein that can be easily broken down by combining LC3-I with phosphatidylethanolamine [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. During autophagy, LC3-I is cleaved and converted to LC3-II, which translocates to the autophagosomal membrane, leading to autophagosome formation. Therefore, the degree of cellular autophagic activity can be judged by the magnitude of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. p62, an important autophagy receptor, is negatively correlated with the number of autophagic lysosomes. p62 also plays a vital role in the regulation of intracellular signaling [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Autophagy is considered an important regulatory factor for myofibroblast differentiation, tissue remodeling, and fibrogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Previous studies have shown an interaction between autophagy and DN fibrosis [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the kidney, indirect evidence from experiments with well-known autophagy inducers also suggested that autophagy has protective effects during DN development [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A study revealed a significant reduction in autophagy levels in the kidney tissue of DN rats, as indicated by an increase in p62 protein levels and a notable decrease in LC3 expression [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another study also revealed that autophagy defects were distinct in the kidney tissue of DN mice and that enhancing autophagy in kidney cells may improve the disease status of DN [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that the activation of autophagy can help patients resist fibrosis and delay DN progression. Podocyte damage has been regarded as the focus of research to decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DN [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Podocyte damage is always accompanied by a decrease in autophagy flux, p62 accumulation, and the interaction between p62 and LC3 [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To investigate whether hyperglycemia leads to renal autophagy dysfunction, we initially examined LC3 and p62 expression in podocytes under hyperglycemic conditions. LC3-II and p62 protein levels were examined in this study to monitor autophagy and autophagic flux. In this study, LC3 expression in diabetic and high-fat kidneys was significantly lower than that in the control group, and p62 expression was significantly greater in diabetic and high-fat kidneys compared with the control group. However, ATX upregulated autophagy in the DM group. Previous studies have demonstrated that the autophagic activity of podocytes decreases after diabetes induction by STZ [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic>, autophagy and its associated proteins were decreased in cultured podocytes exposed to high concentrations of glucose [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that high glucose inhibited autophagy in podocytes, but ATX upregulated autophagy in podocytes, as evidenced by enhanced LC3-II levels and attenuated p62 levels with a reduced number of autophagosomes. The findings of the current study and those of previous reports indicate that autophagy can also be affected by high glucose levels in podocytes and that ATX may inhibit the activation of these cells by increasing autophagy levels. Moreover, our findings showed that diabetic rats and podocytes cultured in high glucose conditions exhibited markedly increased &#x003b1;-SMA and collagen IV expression; however, ATX treatment reversed this effect. These data suggest that ATX might play a role in upregulating the autophagy signaling pathway, which indirectly leads to a reduction in &#x003b1;-SMA and collagen IV expression.</p><p>Abnormalities in podocytes and mesangial cells play a key role in DN development. Crosstalk between mesangial cells and podocytes promotes DN development. Studies have shown that endothelial cells and podocytes in the filtration barrier directly interact with the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in a hyperglycemic environment or regulate mesangial cells through crosstalk to promote DN progression [<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the pathological condition of hyperglycemia, the activation of intracellular signaling molecules leads to dysregulation of vascular growth factors, including VEGF and TGF-&#x003b2;, which are involved in regulating abnormal angiogenesis and eventually albuminuria [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. An article showed that reducing VEGF-B signaling could ameliorate glomerular lipotoxicity and, consequently, DN progression [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Another study showed that overactivation of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway in a high-glucose environment harms mesangial cells, podocytes, and endothelial cells [<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our findings showed that VEGF-B and TGF-&#x003b2; secretion into the supernatant of podocytes increased under high glucose conditions. When the supernatant was transferred to HMCs, autophagy decreased. However, in the supernatant of ATX-treated podocytes, the secretion of pathological crosstalk factors in podocytes and the upregulation of HMC autophagy was inhibited, thereby reducing fibrosis in HMCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" disp-level="1" id="S0005"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study demonstrated that ATX upregulated autophagic activity in podocytes, which may mediate the renoprotective effects induced by DN. Furthermore, crosstalk between podocytes and HMCs potentially causes renal injury in diabetes. However, ATX treatment reversed this phenomenon. From a clinical utility standpoint, this research holds promise for addressing renal fibrosis in DN through oral treatment, thus reducing the medical burden and simultaneously increasing economic benefits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM6433" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="IRNF_A_2378999_SM6433.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Ningbo University for their material support for this project.
