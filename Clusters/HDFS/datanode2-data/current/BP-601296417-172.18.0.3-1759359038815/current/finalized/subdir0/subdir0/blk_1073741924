Inhalation of these pollutants by pregnant women has been linked to abnormal foetal development and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birthweight (LBW). There is a dearth of data on environmental interventions that have the potential to reduce exposure to biomass fuel during pregnancy and improve birth outcomes. International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) therefore, designed a low-cost kitchen with an improved cookstove and examined the impact of this intervention on the birthweight of neonates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>icddr,b conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial of a &#x02018;low-cost kitchen with improved cookstove&#x02019; intervention among 1,267 pregnant women who used traditional cookstoves in a rural sub-district of Bangladesh. All participants were enrolled during the first trimester of pregnancy among 104 randomly selected clusters after obtaining informed consent. The model kitchens were installed in 628 participants' households of the intervention group, and 639 participants continued to use traditional cookstoves as the control group. The primary outcome was the proportion of LBW neonates between the intervention and control groups. The study also examined if the intervention would reduce CO exposure, measured by the differences in maternal blood carbon monoxide saturation (SpCO) levels and prevalence of LBW in neonates. We performed a generalized structural equation model for jointly assessing the simultaneous relationships of biomass fuel exposure to LBW of neonates and the relationships of LBW of neonates to maternal blood SpCO level.

Between the second and third trimester, the mean maternal blood SpCO level was significantly reduced from 10.4% to 8.9% (p-value &#x0003c;0.01) in the intervention group but remained unchanged in the control group (11.6% and 11.5%). Of the total effects of the intervention on the risk of LBW, 48.3% was mediated through maternal blood SpCO level.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>The risk of LBW among rural neonates was reduced in the intervention group using &#x02018;low-cost kitchen with improved cookstove&#x02019;, which may be attributed to the reduction in maternal blood SpCO level. Additional research is needed to identify other mechanisms through which biomass fuel exposure might lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Grand Challenges Canada: Rising Stars in <funding-source id="gs1">Global Health Programme</funding-source>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Low birthweight</kwd><kwd>Carbon monoxide</kwd><kwd>SpCO</kwd><kwd>Cluster randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Low-cost kitchen</kwd><kwd>Improved cookstove</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">

In PubMed, we used the search string (birth weight OR low birth weight OR LBW) AND (indoor air OR biomass OR cooking fuel OR wood smoke). We found five papers published between 2000 and 2012<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> appropriate for household air pollution and about adverse pregnancy outcomes, including LBW in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We found that biomass fuel exposure significantly increases the risk of LBW. The evidence demonstrates the need for a well-designed intervention trial with observational assessment across all the trimesters. During the systematic searching, we found another paper<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> that did a meta-analysis on the effect of biomass fuel exposure on birthweight and infant mortality. We emphasised further randomised control intervention trials to strengthen the evidence on the effect of biomass fuel exposure on pregnancy outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0020">Before our &#x02018;low-cost kitchen with improved cookstove&#x02019; intervention, the only RESPIRE study<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> was a chimney stove trial among pregnant women at different trimesters and identified the relationship between maternal exposure and birthweight of the neonates among the sub-sample based on the use of cookstove during the observation period at pregnancy and not based on randomisation and found 36.0% reduction of LBW prevalence among the sub-sample. The relationship between maternal exposure and birth outcomes is not straightforward. Our study implemented the intervention &#x02018;low-cost kitchen with improved cookstove&#x02019; among the intervention group at a similar period of gestational age of 8&#x02013;12 weeks and measured the concurrent associations of the intervention and prevalence of LBW neonate, maternal blood carbon monoxide saturation (SpCO) level and relationship of prevalence of LBW neonate and maternal blood SpCO levels among the whole sample.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0025">Our study shows that reducing biomass fuel exposure during pregnancy through the use of a low-cost healthier kitchen with improved cookstove reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as LBW prevalence among rural neonates. Moreover, maternal blood SpCO level has been detected as an important factor for controlling adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonate's birthweight. Additional and larger studies can contribute to the global knowledge gaps around the interventions for reducing household air pollution levels and improving pregnancy outcomes in LMICs.</p></sec></boxed-text>

The allocation ratio was 1:1. We measured the pregnancy profiles of women and observed their birth outcomes. The study was conducted in Shahjadpur sub-district of Sirajganj district, which is about 180&#x000a0;km northwest of Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh.

All eligible pregnant women in each cluster were identified by door-to-door visits and invited to enrol in the study. The study health workers, with the assistance of the government community health workers invited the women. Throughout this process, they line-listed 1,695 and 1,587 pregnant women at any gestational ages in intervention and control groups, respectively for 5 months. Then, we allocated a total of 637 eligible pregnant women in the intervention group and a total of 659 eligible pregnant women in the control group.

Once the health workers confirmed the participants' pregnancy and obtained informed written consent, they assigned a unique identification number and recorded age, household address, parents' home address, last date of menstrual period (LMP), expected date of delivery according to LMP, and number and date of visits for each participant. Parent's home address was also recorded to assist in obtaining the birthweight of neonates because women in Bangladesh often go to their parental home to give birth.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="p0085">A team of researchers from icddr,b designed a prefabricated model kitchen.

The walls and roof are made of locally-sourced, inexpensive bamboo with ample ventilation.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The model kitchen includes an improved cookstove with three important pieces to the cookstove's design. First, biomass fuels are placed on a grate, allowing for the wood, dung, leaves, jute sticks, or other materials to completely burn. The grate maintains the optimal distance (10 inches) required for guiding the flames to heat the bottom of the cookware while allowing air to pass underneath to allow complete burning of the fuels. Second, the design of the cookstove allows for smoke to be combusted in controlled conditions. Third, a chimney positioned on the cookstove allows for polluted smoke to rise out of the kitchen, away from pregnant women and their children, decreasing the amount of inhaled air pollutants. The model kitchen with improved cookstove costs about US$100 (range: US$ 95&#x02013;110), including, model kitchen installation and maintenance (US$65), improved cookstove (US$12), distribution (US$5&#x02013;20), and labour cost (US $13).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Model kitchen installation and follow-up visits</title><p id="p0090">All the low-cost model kitchen with improved cookstoves were installed outside the participants' homes in the intervention group within 1&#x02013;2 days of the participant enrolment, and the old smoky kitchen and traditional cookstoves were removed.

We installed more than one improved cookstove in a few households (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14) also where more than one family cooked their food at the same kitchen premise. The assumption was to protect the pregnant woman from inhaling polluted smoke from the other traditional cookstoves even if she was cooking on the improved cookstove.

At each follow-up visit, the FHWs obtained weight (adult weight-scale with standardization), height (length-measuring scale), mid-upper arm circumference, and each participant's blood pressure. The FHWs used a structured questionnaire to record cooking fuel types, cooking area infrastructure, cooking frequency and duration, and participants' staying time in the kitchen. They also recorded maternal age, educational attainment, any pregnancy complications, and iron supplementation at each visit. At the second and third trimester visits, all participants were measured for total oxygen saturation, total haemoglobin, and carbon monoxide saturation (SpCO) level via the non-invasive Masimo rainbow&#x000ae; SET Pulse CO-Oximetric analysis (Model: Radical-7 Colour (9086) with RDS-3 (9023) Docking Station.

If the delivery was in a facility, the study FHWs weighed the neonate's birthweight using the same scale within 72&#x000a0;h. The FHWs could not measure the birthweight of a few enrolled neonates within 72&#x000a0;h of delivery due to several reasons including perinatal deaths and a delay in being informed by the family members.</p><p id="p0105">At 42 days post-birth, the participants were interviewed by the FHWs using a structured questionnaire (concerning their post-pregnancy care and background characteristics). The questionnaire included socio-demographic data e.g., household assets, reproductive history including gravida, parity, any maternal and neonatal complications during the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods, along with their care-seeking behaviours, and the neonatal status. The husband's smoking patterns were also recorded. Ownership of various assets by any member of the household was also recorded. The FHWs again ascertained types of fuel use, choices of fuels, cooking area infrastructure, cooking frequency, and duration, and duration of the participant's stay in the model or traditional kitchen in detail.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>Outcome</title><p id="p0110">The outcomes of the study were measuring (a) the proportion of neonates with LBW between the intervention and control groups; (b) maternal blood carbon monoxide saturation (SpCO) level during the second and third trimester between the intervention and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="sec2.8.1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="p0115">A sample size for cluster RCT had been calculated<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> to test a reduction of LBW from 37% to 24%<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> with 95% CI and 90% power, and 10% intra-cluster correlation.

We measured birthweight of the neonates within 72&#x000a0;h of the deliveries in the data analysis due to avoid biases related to LBW prevalence.

We used principal component analysis to create a household wealth index, which we used as a covariate in these analyses. The assets included durable consumption goods (e.g., table, chair, watch, television, bicycle), housing facilities (e.g., types of toilet, sources of drinking water), housing materials (e.g., types of wall, floor, and roof), and land ownership. The wealth index was categorized into five ordinal categories: least wealthy, less wealthy, wealthy, wealthier, and most wealthy.</p><p id="p0130">We conducted the intention-to-treat analysis with all clusters.

For modelling all the relationships simultaneously, we used generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM) with maximum likelihood estimation to test structural pathways between intervention and LBW that jointly fits three individual regression models: each arrow in the box shows the relationship between an outcome and a key regressor, adjusted for potential confounding covariates (e.g., demographic characteristics). So, we fitted the models with GSEM, where the equation with LBW neonate outcome was fitted with generalized linear model (GLM) specification of a logistic regression model, where family was specified as Bernoulli and link function as logit. All mediational model specifications were specified as simple linear models (with gaussian family and identity link).</p><p id="p0140">All the crude and adjusted effects with 95% CI of neonates&#x02019; birthweight and maternal blood SpCO levels were adjusted by using robust sandwich covariance estimate to account for the clustering.

In our study, the low-cost kitchen with improved cookstove intervention provided a well-ventilated atmosphere and was designed to prevent pregnant women from inhaling carbon monoxide during cooking. As a result, we observed lower SpCO levels among pregnant women in their third trimester in the intervention group (8.9%) compared to the control group (11.5%). We found evidence that maternal blood SpCO levels indirectly affect pregnancy outcomes.

We found considerable uptake and behaviour change among the pregnant women involved in the study, and evidence to support further consideration of such kitchens and cookstoves.</p><p id="p0200">Our study had a few important limitations. There are statistically significant differences between some of the background characteristics of the intervention and the control group. These imbalances are referred as chance bias which occurred by chance in randomisation and might be due to sample size. So, we have adjusted those variables in multivariate analysis to account for this difference. Moreover, we have applied propensity score matching technique to identify the matched cases between intervention and control groups based on their background characteristics including maternal age, parity, BMI, gestational age, wealth index, and smoking status of husband. We found the findings are similar in terms of statistical significance and direction of association (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S6</xref>). Additionally, the main analysis was included all the term and preterm births. For more clarification, we have excluded all the preterm births and found similar differences regarding prevalence of LBW neonate between the intervention and control groups (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). The mediating pathways between using the proposed model kitchen and LBW is understood using GSEM. However, there is a lack of appropriate post-estimation techniques that could give further understanding.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Moreover, we lacked environmental exposure measurement, and therefore, there was a dearth of data related to what extent the model kitchen decreased CO emissions in the household. Instead, we relied on an indirect physiologic measurement in pregnant women (maternal blood SpCO level). We also did not analyse any blood-based biomarkers that would reflect oxidative stress or inflammation which may mediate the association between improved ventilation and higher birthweights.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> We also were limited in our ability to investigate biological pathways through which biomass fuel exposure might lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and any maternal complications. Last, we did not look for the effect of seasonality or sex on the findings.</p><p id="p0205">Women are mainly responsible for cooking in Bangladesh and very little is required in their kitchens. They primarily require a smoke-free environment and a hygienic place to keep their washed utensils. The newly developed model kitchen has addressed all the above needs of the rural mothers. Therefore, our findings support the implementation of safer cooking alternatives than open biomass cookstoves. This finding could stimulate the local level commercial production of such a model kitchen. Moreover, local capacity building could be enhanced by providing extensive training including training of disadvantaged women on improved cookstove construction, enterprise development, leadership and management, and kitchen improvement. Thus, the low-cost kitchen with improved cookstove are scalable, and affordable options that could improve health outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where biomass fuel cooking is the norm. Understanding the physiochemical changes in pregnant women and their foetuses in response to biomass fuel exposure is critical to motivating health policies and health spending priorities in LMICs, including Bangladesh. We recommend such interventions, which may translate to improved maternal and neonatal health in countries with low resource settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0210">All authors were involved in the study design and tools development, intervention design, data analysis, and all aspects of writing the manuscript.
