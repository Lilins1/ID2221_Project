Fox Foundation has been funding research on Parkinson&#x02019;s disease for 35 years, but has yet to find a cure. This is due to a problem with the philosophy behind the development of modern medical treatments. In this paper, we will introduce &#x0201c;smart medicine&#x0201d; with a substance that can solve all the problems of central nervous system drugs. The substance is the smallest diatomic molecule, the hydrogen molecule. Due to their size, hydrogen molecules can easily penetrate the cell membrane and enter the brain. In the midbrain of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients, hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction cause a chain reaction of oxidation of dopamine, but hydrogen entering the midbrain can convert the hydroxyl radicals into water molecules and inhibit the oxidation of dopamine. In this paper, we focus on the etiology of neurological diseases, especially Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and present a case in which hydrogen inhalation improves the symptoms of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, such as body bending and hand tremor. And we confidently state that if Michael J. Fox encountered &#x0201c;smart medicine&#x0201d; that could be realized with molecular hydrogen, he would not be a &#x0201c;lucky man&#x0201d; but a &#x0201c;super-lucky man.&#x0201d;</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>Fenton reaction</kwd><kwd>hydrogen</kwd><kwd>hydroxyl radicals</kwd><kwd>hydrogen-producing bacteria</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>In the 1966 science fiction movie &#x0201c;Fantastic Voyage,&#x0201d; written by Isaac Asimov, the submarine &#x0201c;Proteus&#x0201d; carries a medical team that was miniaturized and sent into a patient to reach the brain through blood vessels and successfully burn off the hematoma of a cerebral hemorrhage with a laser.

The supply of iron ions to the brain is carried out through the blood-brain barrier by endocytosis via transferrin receptors in the blood, and the discharge of iron ions returns to the circulatory system via the cerebrospinal fluid. Once in the brain, iron is supplemented by ferritin, an iron storage protein found in cells and mitochondria. The iron ions supplemented by ferritin remain stable within the ferritin without causing cellular damage.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, if metal metabolism in the brain is disrupted for some reason and there are too many iron ions in the brain for ferritin to supplement, the iron ions are released into brain cells and mitochondria.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> When the released iron ions react with endogenous hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals with strong oxidizing power are produced (Fenton reaction; equation 1).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The hydroxyl radicals react with lipids, proteins, and DNA, resulting in cellular and mitochondrial damage.

Neurite degeneration is induced by oxidation of the cell membrane. It has been confirmed that neurite damage is induced by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the cell culture medium. The hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton reaction deprive the lipids that make up the cell membrane of electrons to produce lipid peroxides, resulting in the loss of fluidity of the cell membrane and consequently cell damage. Thus, the degeneration of neuronal processes that occurs prior to neuronal cell death is triggered by hydroxyl radicals.</p><p>The denaturation of neurites <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> caused by hydrogen peroxide to the medium can be inhibited by vitamin E, an antioxidant, because hydrogen peroxide acts from outside the cell to inside the cell.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, hydroxyl radicals that generate hydroxyl radicals are usually produced inside the mitochondria of the cell, and fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E cannot reach the inside of the mitochondria, which allows hydroxyl radicals generated inside the cell to attack the mitochondrial membrane.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>P<sc>ARKINSON&#x02019;S</sc> D<sc>ISEASE</sc> &#x02013; D<sc>OPAMINE</sc> C<sc>HAIN</sc> O<sc>XIDATION BY</sc> F<sc>ENTON</sc> R<sc>EACTION</sc></title><p>In the midbrain of able-bodied person, dopaminergic nerves where dopamine is biosynthesized are densely packed.

The degradation of dopamine is catalyzed by monoamine oxidase in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which generates hydrogen peroxide.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Hydrogen peroxide generates hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction, which oxidizes dopamine to 6-hydroxyl-dopamine (6-OHDA).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Because injection of 6-OHDA into the ventricles of mice causes marked dopaminergic cell loss and progressive substantia nigra degeneration, 6-OHDA has been used in mouse models of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease due to its neurotoxic effects.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> 6-OHDA reacts with molecular oxygen to form superoxide, which is then supplied with hydrogen ions and electrons to form hydrogen peroxide.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The generated hydrogen peroxide oxidizes dopamine again to produce 6-OHDA, starting an endless chain reaction (<bold><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>).

The substantia nigra of the midbrain, which is responsible for Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, is located deep in the center of the brain. However, there are at least four major barriers to get through in order to target the substantia nigrato deliver of drugs and dopamine: passage through the blood-brain barrier, targeting the mitochondria, the elimination of drug metabolites, and limitations of the drug itself.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Blood-brain barrier</title><p>The first difficulty in drug discovery for the central nervous system is to pass the blood-brain barrier. Capillary endothelial cells in the brain are composed of tight junctions that connect the cells to each other.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This structure prevents the indiscriminate entry of drugs from the blood into the intercellular fluid of the brain. Transporters and receptors with various substrate specificities are expressed in the blood-brain barrier, controlling the movement of selective substances, and drugs that can pass into the brain are limited in terms of physical properties.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Recently, it has become clear that the onset and pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease cause changes in cell adhesion and in the transporters that make up the blood-brain barrier, resulting in a barrier function that is different from that of normal cells, making it extremely difficult to develop drugs for the central nervous system.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Drugs can be directly injected into the brain, but this approach is invasive.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Drug delivery to the mitochondria</title><p>Once a drug has successfully crossed the blood-brain barrier, the next difficulty is delivering the drug to the mitochondria of brain cells. Mitochondria have a double membrane structure (inner and outer membranes). While the outer membrane of mitochondria can nonspecifically permeate low-molecular-weight substances of up to 5 kDa, the inner membrane of mitochondria has an extremely high resistance to drug permeation, making drug delivery very difficult.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In order to achieve drug delivery to mitochondria, this high barrier must be overcome. Attempts have been made to selectively deliver antioxidants into the mitochondria, but this has not yet resulted in an effective disease treatment.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Expulsion of drug metabolites</title><p>Just as the submarine Proteus escaped from the brain and returned to the outside of the body after its mission in the Fantastic Voyage was completed, the metabolites of the drug that complete its mission must also be discharged from the body. This is because even when the drug reaches the mitochondria safely, if the metabolites of the drug are not discharged outside the mitochondria, they may accumulate inside the mitochondria and cause unpredictable side effects.</p><p>A transport system that actively discharges metabolites exists at the blood-brain barrier. However, for drug metabolites that reach the brain, they must be discharged from the mitochondria to the outside of the cell and then from the brain to the blood stream.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This requires a drug discovery concept that is the exact opposite of drug delivery to the mitochondria, and it is extremely difficult to achieve both drug delivery and discharge.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Limitations of drug efficacy</title><p>Levodopa, the precursor of dopamine, is currently an effective drug in the treatment of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, but it is a treatment that only inhibits progression. It also has a short halflife in the blood, meaning it hardly reaches the brain.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In the book &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">Awakening</italic>&#x0201d; by Oliver Sacks, a patient who developed Parkinson&#x02019;s disease after encephalitis was given levodopa to awaken him, but the effect waned due to drug resistance.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This drug tolerance was depicted as a wearing-off phenomenon, where the time for the drug to work was shortened and the drug dose had to be increased. Another possibility is the on-and-off phenomenon, where the symptoms suddenly get better or worse regardless of when the drug is taken, but eventually get worse. This is a limitation of modern medicine.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>S<sc>UPER</sc> L<sc>UCKY</sc> M<sc>AN</sc></title><p>The conventional approach to drug discovery, which is to create a single drug for a single brain disease, is difficult because of the many issues that must be overcome. Molecular hydrogen can solve all of these problems.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Because of its excellent diffusivity, hydrogen can penetrate the cell membranes that make up the blood-brain barrier, enter the brain, reach the dopamine cells in the substantia nigra of the midbrain, and scavenge the hydroxyl radicals that are constantly being generated inside the mitochondria of the dopamine cells.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Furthermore, molecular hydrogen would stop the vicious cycle of the chain reaction of dopamine by converting the hydroxyl radicals inside the brain mitochondria into water molecules. Since the reaction products of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals are also only water molecules, the drug metabolites, which are foreign to the brain like pharmaceuticals, will not remain in the brain. The excess molecular hydrogen is naturally expelled from the brain by diffusion. Only molecular hydrogen can convert hydroxyl radicals, which are the cause of almost all neurodegenerative diseases, into water molecules in the brain (equation 2). If the oxidation reaction of dopamine can be inhibited, the symptoms of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease will be improved by the accumulation of dopamine due to the inherent dopaminergic capacity of dopamine cells. In fact, the onset and progression of substantia nigra degeneration were effectively suppressed in a Parkinson&#x02019;s disease mouse in which 6-OHDA was injected into the brain to induce substantia nigra degeneration, and the mice were given 50% saturated hydrogen water to drink freely.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This is thought to be due to the fact that the hydrogen molecules ingested by drinking the water reached the brain and suppressed the dopamine chain oxidation reaction by the Fenton reaction as described above.</p><p>H<sub>2</sub> + 2&#x000b7;OH &#x02192; 2H<sub>2</sub>O&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;(2)</p><p>In fact, in animal experiments, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease has been improved by inhaling hydrogen gas and drinking hydrogen water.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Because the brain size of small animals, such as mice and rats, differs from that of humans, it is necessary to inhale a larger amount of hydrogen in order to have a significant effect on Parkinson&#x02019;s disease in humans. However, since hydrogen has no side effects, if people could inhale it all day long in a facility like a hydrogen room, for example, hydrogen could stop the progression of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and perhaps even lead to improvement. In his book <italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Lucky Man</italic>,&#x0201d; Michael J. Fox, a Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patient, became interested in research on embryonic stem cells and the transplantation of dopaminergic cells, which can produce dopamine, into the substantia nigra of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, even if dopaminergic cells are transplanted into the substantia nigra of the midbrain, dopamine will continue to be destroyed unless the hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron ions accumulated in the midbrain of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients are stopped. Hydrogen is the only substance that can convert hydroxyl radicals in the brain into water molecules and stop the chain oxidation of dopamine by the Fenton reaction. Hydrogen inhalation therapy is noninvasive, so there is no need to drill into the skull and implant a chip that provides electrical stimulation to the brain. If patients suffering from neurological disorders, including Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and post-traumatic stress disorder, were treated with hydrogen, they would all be &#x0201c;super lucky.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>R<sc>EPORT ON</sc> T<sc>HE</sc> I<sc>MPROVEMENT OF</sc> P<sc>ARKINSON&#x02019;S</sc> D<sc>ISEASE BY</sc> H<sc>YDROGEN</sc> I<sc>NHALATION</sc></title><p>There have been reports of improvement in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease by drinking hydrogen water.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, when drinking hydrogen water, the amount of hydrogen intake is limited to the amount of hydrogen water that the patient can drink. With hydrogen gas inhalation, patients can consume more hydrogen without filling up their stomachs with water. Therefore, we recruited Japanese patients diagnosed with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease to monitor the effects of hydrogen gas inhalation on their health. After informed consent, they all used a hydrogen gas inhaler manufactured by MiZ Company Limited (Kanagawa, Japan), which controls the concentration of hydrogen to 10% by volume without the risk of hydrogen explosion.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Case 1</title><p>A Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patient (67-year-old male, medical history: about 8 years) inhaled a mixed gas of hydrogen and air using a gaseous hydrogen inhalation apparatus (MHG-2000a; MiZ Company Limited) for about 90 minutes per day over about 2 months.

These studies have reported that metabolites produced by endobacteria, such as intestinal short-chain fatty acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, and trimethylamine, have an effect on the brain, but these effects are often unclear.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>For example, <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides fragilis,</italic> the predominant intestinal bacterium in humans and mice, has an extracellular polysaccharide, polysaccharide A.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Polysaccharide A suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by inducing regulatory T cells.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Bacteroides, on the other hand, are decreased in patients with dementia, suggesting that they may have some effects on dementia.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, dementia is a brain disease, and it is not clear how Bacteroides, which reside in the intestine and are far from the brain, act. The solution to this problem is hydrogen.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Bacteroides are a hydrogen-producing bacterium with hydrogenase, an enzyme that produces hydrogen. The hydrogen produced by Bacteroides not only suppresses inflammation in the intestines, but some of it also travels through the bloodstream to the brain. Since hydrogen has excellent diffusivity and can penetrate cell membranes, it can pass through the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain. The hydrogen that enters the brain also penetrates the mitochondrial membranes of brain cells, enters the brain cell mitochondria, scavenges hydroxyl radicals, which are the causative agents of inflammation, and protects the brain from damage from hydroxyl radicals. When the number of Bacteroides is low, the amount of hydrogen produced by Bacteroides is also reduced, thus weakening the brain&#x02019;s defenses against hydrogen, which is thought to be the cause of dementia (<bold><xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). Bacteroides, a hydrogen-producing bacterium, was significantly lower in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and dementia, suggesting that hydrogen produced by hydrogen-producing bacteria in the intestines may contribute to the prevention of neurological diseases such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> To improve Parkinson&#x02019;s disease once it has developed, the amount of hydrogen produced by hydrogen-producing bacteria in the intestines will not be enough, and more active inhalation of hydrogen will be important. Although many cases of hydrogen improving neurological disorders of the brain have been reported, the ameliorative effect of hydrogen on Parkinson&#x02019;s disease has not been stable, which is thought to be due to the fact that the amount of hydrogen inhaled is too small.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Since the midbrain, where Parkinson&#x02019;s disease is located, is in the center of the brain, it is important to send more hydrogen into the brain through prolonged hydrogen inhalation to ensure that it reaches the midbrain.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Molecular hydrogen produced by hydrogen-producing bacteria in the intestines reaches the brain and protects it against hydroxyl radical damage.</p><p>Note: Created with Microsoft PowerPoint.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MGR-14-89-g005" position="float"/></fig><p>Alkahest, a company in San Carlos, CA, USA acquired by a Spanish manufacturer of plasma products, is conducting trials for the treatment of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and dementia. It is also looking for target molecules in the blood of elderly people and developing relevant drugs. However, molecular hydrogen in the blood is not one of these molecules. Molecular hydrogen is a very light molecule and is quickly released from the blood and into the atmosphere. We are excited to learn their reaction when they detect the presence of molecular hydrogen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-8"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The therapeutic effect of hydrogen on the brain has been introduced in this paper. Since hydrogen can reach not only the brain but also the whole body due to its diffusivity, it is also effective against diseases of organs other than the brain. Above all, since hydrogen therapy requires only inhalation, it is available to all people, regardless of social status.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The ever-increasing cost of medical care in the face of an aging society is a concern for many countries around the world.
