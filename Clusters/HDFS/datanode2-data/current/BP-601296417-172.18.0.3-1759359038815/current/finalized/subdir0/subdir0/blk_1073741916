</p><sec id="sec0001"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p id="para0011">Nurse delivery of high-quality information to caregivers&#x02014;the necessary medical information to promote maintenance and recovery&#x02014;is critical for care of the patient following discharge from the hospital. Hospital discharge refers to the process of releasing a patient following a procedure or treatment and often involves the review of a discharge plan that provides instructions for ongoing patient care, including medications and rehabilitation (<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">An, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Gon&#x000e7;alves-Bradley et al., 2016</xref>). If a patient is unable to care for themselves following discharge, caregivers are recipients of the discharge plan and expected to provide ongoing patient care (<xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">Rodakowski et al., 2017</xref>). This is especially true for caregivers of older adults with serious illness&#x02014;a health condition that presents greater risk for mortality, can negatively impact daily functioning or quality of life, or requires substantial involvement from caregivers (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Kelley and Lund, 2018</xref>). Among this group are patients with cognitive decline, such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, where 80 % of patients require caregiver support (<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2023</xref>). Caregivers play a substantial, but often undervalued role in the health care system. As of 2014 there were a reported 18 million informal caregivers in the United States (US) (<xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">Spillman et al., 2014</xref>), a number which is increasing with the aging of the &#x0201c;baby boom&#x0201d; generation (<xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">AARP, 2020</xref>). For older adults with serious illness like Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, caregivers are often the direct point of contact for providers. To ensure awareness of a patient's health status, providers collaborate with caregivers by confirming understanding of directions for medical treatment and may rely on caregivers to make decisions on behalf of the patient if the patient is deemed cognitively impaired (<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Hagedoorn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">Sawan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="para0012">Previous researchers have found that caregivers report better preparedness when they are offered more involvement in the coordination of care, as partners in the patient care experience (<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Hagedoorn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">Liebzeit et al., 2023</xref>). Based on the seminal work of <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">Archbold et al. (1990)</xref>, preparedness refers to the extent to which caregivers believe themselves ready for the tasks and stressors of the caregiving role. Greater coordination with caregivers can lead to higher levels of preparedness (<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Hagedoorn et al., 2020</xref>), reduced anxiety (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Burgstaller et al., 2018</xref>), and greater self-efficacy in their ability to manage patient care (<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Merrilees et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, a lack of actual and perceived preparedness can be detrimental to both caregiver and patient. Informal caregivers frequently report a lack of preparedness to address patients&#x02019; medical needs (<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Hagedoorn et al., 2020</xref>), potentially contributing to caregiver burden, subsequent patient hospitalizations, or admission to a long-term care facility (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Bailes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib0054" ref-type="bibr">Towle et al., 2020</xref>), and, in more severe cases, may result in patient mortality (<xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="para0013">Fortunately, informal caregivers experience a reduction in stress and burden and an increase in caring ability when nurses incorporate care models that foster caregiver activation by instructing caregivers on how to treat the patient and, at the same time, recognize the caregiver's need for physical, psychosocial, and environmental support (<xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2022</xref>). The communicative exchange between informal caregivers and nurses has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms and facilitate improved caregiver physical and emotional coping strategies (<xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">Steffen et al., 2019</xref>). Nurses can optimize care by tailoring messages to the informal caregiver's specific needs, such as recommending support groups, case management, and the availability of respite care (<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Bleijlevens et al., 2015</xref>). In acute inpatient care, nurses can play an important role in fostering caregiver activation and preparedness. Researchers suggest that the perceived ability to manage the medical needs of the patient post-discharge can act as a protective factor against the stressors affiliated with caregiving, which can ultimately benefit patient health (<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Merrilees et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">Steffen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="para0014">In the inpatient setting, nurses typically spend more time with the patient and caregiver than any other healthcare provider. Nurses are also largely responsible for the delivery of discharge information to caregivers. Unfortunately, due to systemic and organizational factors, time spent interacting with caregivers is decreasing (<xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">Kwame and Petrucka, 2021</xref>). In addition to the increasing professional demands at the bedside, nurses often struggle to deliver high-quality information to caregivers due to a lack of communication training, greater workloads, and fewer support resources for managing care (<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Kang and Hur, 2021</xref>). Nurses are increasingly reporting experiences of burnout and compassion fatigue, which has been linked to a reduction in the quality of care provided (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">Dyrbye et al., 2017</xref>). Researchers found that amidst these demands, features of communication can work to enhance the delivery of high-quality information and support of the caregiver, which can positively impact nurse outcomes related to burnout and professional satisfaction (<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Darban et al., 2016</xref>). For example, reviewing a patient's social history or sitting down to deliver information (<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">Ferrell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Solli et al., 2015</xref>) is associated with reduced medical errors, fewer nurse turnover rates, and higher morale (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Deeks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">Khrone, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib0057" ref-type="bibr">Urashima et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, creating opportunities for nurses to engage in interpersonal communication with caregivers will likely improve nurse care experiences and caregiver activation and preparedness, thereby improving patient care. Despite the evidence highlighting the ways to and the need for enhancing nurse delivery of high-quality information with caregivers at discharge, a comprehensive synthesis of best practices does not exist.</p><p id="para0015">To address this need, a scoping review was used to explore evidence of effective nurse communication with caregivers during hospital discharge of older adult patients with cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias to identify strategies for enhancing nurse delivery of high-quality information to caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p id="para0016">Scoping reviews aim to synthesize evidence and assess the scope of literature on a topic (<xref rid="bib0056" ref-type="bibr">Tricco et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the distinctive nature and range of study designs and measures examining discharge conversations, the scoping review approach affords a comprehensive summary of existing research. Three databases were chosen (Medline, PsycInfo, CINHAL) for the search due to their applicability to the study area. An initial search was conducted in 2021 to locate research over the past 10 years (2011&#x02013;2021). During the synthesis process, a subsequent search was conducted (2021&#x02013;2023) to locate any additional applicable articles.</p><sec id="sec0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Study selection</title><p id="para0017">Inclusion criteria required that articles include inpatient nurses and informal caregivers in the context of patients with cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias aged 65 years or older. For extraction purposes, we also ensured all articles included an interpersonal communication intervention where communication was observed or perceived, along with outcomes related to nurse professional fulfillment and caregiver activation or preparedness. Articles published in any language were accepted, and Google Translate was used to convert articles into English (if no English version was available) (<xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>). Articles that included interventions involving technology or communication exchanged after discharge were excluded, along with pediatric studies, at-home care/home health settings, and those that were fewer than three pages to limit extended abstracts or incomplete published trials.</p><p id="para0018">Three research librarians (G.B., J.D., E.C.) assisted in developing search term criteria, including determination of keywords and MeSH terms applicable to each database (see Search Terms in Supplementary Materials 1). All articles identified through the initial search were uploaded into the systematic review tool Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd., Melbourne 2018). The tool automatically filters duplicates and tracks article reviews. Once articles were uploaded into Covidence, articles were flagged for duplication and removed. Additional gray literature was identified through general searches outside the selected databases and added to Covidence for review. Due to the limited number of studies focused on the interpersonal exchange between nurses and caregivers during hospital discharge, the inclusion of gray literature increased the comprehensiveness and scope of available research (<xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">Paez, 2017</xref>). The PRISMA for scoping review screening process was followed (see Supplementary Materials 2 for PRISMA chart 2021&#x02013;2021). Four members of the research team (A.J., V.J., G.D., M.H.) independently reviewed the title/abstract and full-text articles. Reviewers included two undergraduate research assistants with backgrounds in communication studies and public health, a Doctor of Nursing Practice candidate, and a health communication scholar. Each article was reviewed twice, and instances of reviewer discrepancy resulted in a third review. A quality assessment of the articles was conducted to validate synthesis results (<xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">Pollock et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib0059" ref-type="bibr">Yosep et al., 2023</xref>). Informed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, which accounts for literature involving qualitative research methods, no studies were excluded due to low quality (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">CASP, 2018</xref>). A second literature search for articles from 2021 to 2023 followed the same procedures. All identified eligible articles were already included in the initial search. Therefore, no additional articles were added (see Supplementary Materials 2 for PRISMA chart 2021&#x02013;2023).</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><label>2.2</label><title>Data synthesis and analysis</title><p id="para0019">For each included study, two members of the research team (A.J., G.D.), in consultation with a third member (M.H.), extracted study author(s) and year, study design, objectives, intervention description, and main findings according to nurse and caregiver outcomes (see <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for extraction summary). The main findings were further analyzed to extract features of communication recognized as enhancing the delivery of high-quality information during discharge conversations, thereby promoting nurse professional fulfillment outcomes or supporting caregiver activation and preparedness. To further refine findings and provide clearer recommendations for enhancing the hospital discharge experience for nurses and caregivers, what Arksey and O'Malley refer to as &#x02018;charting the data&#x02019;, a thematic analysis was conducted (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Arksey and O'Malley, 2005</xref>, p. 15; <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2023</xref>).

Two studies required translation (from German and traditional Chinese). After translation, both articles did not meet eligibility criteria and were excluded. Following title and abstract screening, 49 articles were moved to full-text screening. Among those articles, 31 were excluded based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, leaving 18 articles for synthesis. Quality assessment determined all research article procedures to be valid, impactful, and rigorous. Among the studies included, 12 involved qualitative methods, two were literature reviews, two used quantitative methods, one was a cohort-based study, and one was a clinical expert perspective piece. Following synthesis of 18 articles, extracting features of communication that work to enhance nurse delivery of high-quality information during discharge conversations, two overarching themes were identified: Support and Structure. Each overarching theme included three sub-themes. Sub-themes for Support included Information exchange, Space and time to determine preparedness, and Positive reinforcement.

Another example of informational resources was in the form of patient pictures or &#x0201c;About Me&#x0201d; worksheets that could be displayed next to the patient's bed to give the care team a better sense of whom they were caring for and to familiarize the patient with their surroundings (<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">Kelley et al., 2019</xref>).

Through the process of extraction and synthesis, communication practices were further refined into two overarching themes of Support and Structure. These themes and relevant sub-themes presented a range of communication approaches evidenced to improve the nurse care experience as well as caregiver activation and preparedness.</p><p id="para0030">Researchers suggested there were a variety of interpersonal communication techniques that nurses could adopt to facilitate delivery of high-quality information to caregivers at discharge (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Solli et al., 2015</xref>). However, amidst the research surrounding nurse communication with caregivers, only one group of researchers considered the impact of communication engagement on nurse outcomes (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Gwernan-Jones et al., 2020</xref>). Given the real environmental pressures surrounding the discharge conversation and recognized need to improve nurse care experience (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Deeks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Kang and Hur, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">Kwame and Petrucka, 2021</xref>), more studies should account for nurse engagement with communication-based interventions and perceived impacts on professional fulfillment.</p><p id="para0031">We also observed the overlap between themes, highlighting that structure facilitates support. This observation is consistent with previous research. <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2023)</xref> used a socio-ecological model to understand the facilitators and barriers in palliative care delivery among patients with Parkinson's Disease. The socio-ecological model accounted for the communication across levels within the healthcare system, from individual patient needs to interpersonal support and system-level efforts to standardize palliative care consults. The findings from our scoping review suggest that the socio-ecological model may be useful for examining the multilevel factors involved in the hospital discharge process and identifying interpersonal and structural interventions for enhancing the discharge experience. For example, standardizing a goal attainment discussion in every discharge conversation could serve as a useful strategy to effectively set expectations, identify needs, and confirm shared understanding&#x02014;all of which support the efforts of nurses and caregivers. Like support, many of the structure themes could reasonably be embedded in existing discharge processes, with some exceptions. Ensuring adequate staffing, allocating time, scheduling nurses according to illness expertise, and staff trainings require additional resources that may not be available. Although these structural changes could aid in enhancing discharge conversations, we present multiple alternatives that likely offer similar outcomes.</p><p id="para0032">Finally, through our analysis, we identified a lack of empirical research using communication-based interventions designed to improve the discharge conversation experience for caregivers and nurses. Most of the studies included used qualitative methodologies, such as interviews, to gather perspectives and experiences. Although these qualitative methods afford a richness in understanding barriers and facilitators to effective discharge conversations, they do not offer evidence or scalable models for widespread adoption. During our review process, many communication-based interventions focused on digital interfaces and continuity of care interaction following discharge. Although these are important to patient care, these infrastructures are often costly, difficult to access, and harder to sustain long-term (<xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">Ownsworth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Toye et al., 2016</xref>). Future research that explores the efficacy of communication-based interventions involving low-demand support and structural strategies during the discharge encounter may prove useful in reducing the need for subsequent communication channels. We also note the absence of disruptions during discharge conversations. It is likely that discharge conversations are often interrupted due to competing clinical demands (<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Kang and Hur, 2021</xref>). Understanding how these interruptions impact delivery of discharge information is a potential gap in the literature and introduces opportunities for future research. From a policy perspective, changes such as the US 2024 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, which allows providers to bill for caregiver education and training, would also likely increase the feasibility of incorporating interventions to support nurse communication with caregivers in the context of patient discharge (<xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">National Alliance for Caregiving, 2024</xref>).</p><sec id="sec0009"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="para0033">Due to the prevalence of caregiver involvement, we focused on the communicative exchange between nurse and caregiver during discharge of older patients with cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.

Due to the inclusion of research displaying a wide range of methodologies, we were unable to produce more systematic findings. The nature of the data, however, provides nuance to the distinct features of communication occurring at discharge and opportunities to improve the discharge experience.

The use of Google translate at this stage could have resulted in translation and interpretation errors that may have impacted our determination of study eligibility. We also excluded articles that included communication modalities beyond face-to-face, such as Zoom. In many cases, Zoom or similar alternative forms of communication appeared in research on home-based care interventions following discharge. We recognize that by excluding this research we are limiting the range of communication strategies possible. Most studies included in the review were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, which should be considered in terms of generalizability and transferability.
