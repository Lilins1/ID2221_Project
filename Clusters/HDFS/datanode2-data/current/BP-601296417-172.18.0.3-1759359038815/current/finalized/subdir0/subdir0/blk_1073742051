According to the Vision Loss Expert Group of the Global Burden of Disease Study published by The Lancet, in older populations, cataracts and glaucoma were the two leading causes of blindness globally.[ ] Around 76 million individuals aged 40–80 years suffered from glaucoma in 2020, with a predicted constant increment in prevalence to reach 112 million individuals by 2040, affecting more people in Asia and Africa.[ ] The main risk factor for the development and progression of the disease is intraocular pressure (IOP). Thus, the mainstay treatment of glaucoma is to reduce IOP through drugs or surgical intervention.[ ] Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common subtype of glaucoma.[ ] The prevalence of POAG is closely related to age, with an increased odds ratio prevalence of 1.73 for each decade increase in age.[ ] Cataracts, the leading cause of blindness globally, also contribute largely to the prevalence of age-related eye diseases. With increasing life expectancy, their coexistence is becoming more common in the elderly population.[ ] As aging is one of the most influencing risk factors in eye disease, the aging population will directly increase the number of people with cataracts and glaucoma.[ ]\n\nThere is currently no clear consensus on the management of these concomitant diseases. From a surgical standpoint, cataract surgery may enhance aqueous drainage; however, patients are more likely to require medication postoperatively.[ ] In addition, for patients with OAG, this might be insufficient to reach the IOP goal; thus, conventionally, phacoemulsification with trabeculectomy is the approach taken.[ ]\n\nTrabeculectomy is the gold standard of glaucoma surgical management. However, despite its effectiveness and success in reducing IOP, trabeculectomy is associated with prolonged recovery time and postoperative complications such as choroidal effusion, hyphema, bleb leak, and ptosis.[ ]\n\nMicroinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) is a novel surgical method mainly used to treat mild and moderate glaucoma by lowering the IOP with as minimum trauma as possible while avoiding the postoperative complications encountered in conventional glaucoma filtration surgery.[ ] MIGS constitute several groups of surgical approaches that share common characteristics: high safety profile, enhanced aqueous outflow mechanism without major alteration of ocular anatomy, an ab interno approach, comparable efficacy to traditional filtering surgery, and rapid recovery with the least additional downtime.[ ]\n\nThe approaches in the MIGS procedure reduce IOP through one or several of the following four mechanisms: (1) enhancing trabecular outflow, (2) ablation of the ciliary body to decrease aqueous production, (3) increased alternate pathway outflow, and (4) subconjunctival filtration.[ ]\n\nThe trabecular meshwork offers the greatest resistance to aqueous outflow. MIGS procedure that aims to enhance trabecular outflow may do so by stenting (i.e., iStent, Hydrus) to circumvent the aqueous flow to allow direct drainage from the anterior chamber into Schlemm’s canal, trabecular meshwork tissue excision (i.e., Trabectome), or widening of the Schlemm’s canal. Other MIGS work to enhance aqueous outflow through the uveoscleral pathway (i.e., CyPass microstent) or into the subconjunctival space (i.e., XEN glaucoma implants). Lastly, another target for MIGS procedures to reach the IOP goal is reducing aqueous production through ciliary body ablation by using a laser unit (i.e., endocyclophotocoagulation). Compared to trabeculectomy, MIGS in conjunction with phacoemulsification may provide the same benefit with fewer complications in individuals with mild-to-moderate glaucoma and a population that does not meet the criteria of trabeculectomy.[ ]\n\nThis study aimed to assess the current knowledge of combination surgery in patients with cataract and OAG to provide a comprehensive understanding and guidance in clinical practice."}

ROP occurs in preterm children before complete vascularization of the retina, which may affect the central retina and impair visual acuity.[ ] The development of retinal blood vessels is initiated from the optic disc and extends to the central retina at a gestational age (GA) of 16 weeks. During vascular development, retinal vessels grow in a radial direction, sparing the central fovea, to form the foveal avascular zone (FAZ).[ ] Data suggest that the period between 24 and 27 weeks of gestation is vital for foveal development as it encompasses vascular plexus development and foveal pit formation.[ ] Therefore, preterm children are more likely to experience a delay in macular development.[ ] Conventional treatment modalities for ROP include cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation (LP) for the avascular retina, which attempt to prevent disease progression. The effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has also been identified. Subsequent research has reported that intravitreal anti-VEGF injection could have better therapeutic value for severe ROP, leading to prompt regression.[ ] Some recent studies have shown that preterm-born children who do not develop ROP or those with a history of spontaneously regressed or treated ROP do not have a completely normal retinal microstructure. Updating imaging technology is conducive to identifying subtle anatomical distinctions that may not be detectable clinically.\n\nOptical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a relatively novel and non-invasive imaging technique that facilitates better visualization and quantification of the retinal vasculature.[ ] The advantages of OCTA over conventional fluorescein angiography (FA) include efficient acquisition and non-invasiveness. Importantly, OCTA can quantitatively assess the FAZ area, superficial capillary plexus vessel density (SCP-VD), and deep capillary plexus vessel density (DCP-VD). Several studies have examined and compared the variations in the retinal microvasculature in preterm-born children with those of their counterparts born at a normal GA with a normal birthweight (BW) by using OCTA, albeit with inconsistent results.[ ] Therefore, a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies is required to overcome this shortcoming.\n\nNo meta-analysis has systematically investigated the structural changes in the retinal microvasculature by using OCTA in preterm-born children. Hence, the present meta-analysis assessed retinal microvascular characteristics in preterm-born children who received treatment with either LP (LP-ROP) or anti-VEGF agents (anti-VEGF-ROP), children with spontaneous regression of ROP (SR-ROP), and children who did not develop ROP (Pre-T-ROP) compared to term-born children. The results demonstrated that OCTA can be used to detect the characteristics of structural changes in the retinal microvasculature in preterm children."}
