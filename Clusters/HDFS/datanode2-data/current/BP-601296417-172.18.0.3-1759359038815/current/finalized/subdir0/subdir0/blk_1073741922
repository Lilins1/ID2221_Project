An ANC visit was deemed of quality if all of these services were received in that visit.

Q-ANC coverage in the public facility was significantly lower in the 4th ANC visit (25.1%; 95% CI 23.4&#x02013;26.9) as compared with visits 1 to 3, whereas it was the highest for 1st ANC visit with private provider (50.2%; 95% CI 49.2&#x02013;51.1) and then dropped for visits 2 to 4. Irrespective of the source of ANC services, Q-ANC coverage increased significantly with increasing WI quartile for ANC visits 1 and 2, with WI quartile 3 women having significantly less coverage for ANC visit 3 compared to the rest, and no significant difference seen in the coverage of ANC 4 visit.

<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><sec id="dtbox1sec1"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="p0015">Despite the evidence on the poor quality of antenatal care (ANC) services predominately from the demographic and health surveys (DHS), significant gap remains in the understanding of quality-adjusted coverage at the population-level for each ANC visit and by the source of ANC services, and in equity in this coverage. We searched PubMed with the terms {&#x0201c;antenatal care services&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;quality&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;India&#x0201d;} and {&#x0201c;antenatal care services&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;equity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;India&#x0201d;} to identify articles published in English without time period restriction on 6 March 2023. The first set resulted in 21 publications and the second only 1. Most publications on quality of ANC services were based on secondary analysis of the national family health survey data defining quality if the pregnant woman received a combination of ANC service components at any point or at least once during the pregnancy irrespective of the number of ANC visits. Other publications reported quality of ANC services from facility observations or reported the reasons for poor quality of ANC services at the facility-level.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0020">This is one of the first population-based studies reporting on quality by each ANC visit disaggregated by source of ANC services and wealth index. We found the quality-adjusted coverage of ANC services lagging considerably behind the crude ANC coverage, and disaggregated analysis has highlighted significant inequities in quality coverage between the ANC visits and by source of ANC services. Improving access to ANC services by bringing it closer to the community but without appropriate quality interferes with the overall coverage of ANC services, as the study has documented that the quality of 1st ANC visit matters in ensuring that a pregnant woman completes the desired number of ANC visits. The rich-poor gap in quality-adjusted coverage of ANC services is seen in 1st and 2nd ANC visits, which disappears in the 3rd and 4th ANC visits. The quality of ANC services drops from the 1st to 4th ANC visit in both public facility and with private providers.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0025">This study offers a more nuanced understanding of the quality of ANC services than the DHS, by highlighting the urgent need to not only provide but to also sustain quality ANC services for pregnant woman irrespective of the number of ANC visits or the source of ANC services. With widespread poor quality of ANC services in this population, the focus of health system should be on improving the ANC components that have the least coverage in addition to addressing the system-related issues for provision of quality ANC services.</p></sec></boxed-text>

Date of birth, sex of the baby born, and whether it was a livebirth or stillbirth was documented for each birth.

For the analysis presented, the interview of these women documented sociodemographic information and the number of ANC visits sought during pregnancy with the focal child. We undertook detailed documentation for all ANC visits up to a maximum of first four ANC visits for each woman which included the source of ANC services, gestation month at each visit, and the services received (weight measurement, blood pressure checked, abdomen checked, urine sample taken, and blood sample taken) for each visit. We collected information on whether the women had received Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets/syrup and Calcium tablets anytime during the pregnancy with the focal child.</p><p id="p0065">Data collection was completed between August 2021 and April 2022. The questionnaire was developed in English and then translated into Hindi (local language), after which these were back-translated into English to ensure the accurate and relevant meaning and intent of the questions. Pilot testing of the questionnaire was carried out and modifications made as necessary. Interviews were captured using the Computer-assisted Personal Interview software in hand-held tablets. A total of 10% of the enumeration data were checked from 50% of the sampled clusters, which translated into 670 clusters. Similarly, a total of 20% of interviews were checked in 50% of the 1340 sampled clusters.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Analysis presented in this paper</title><p id="p0070">Since the sample was a multi-stage stratified cluster sample, sampling weights were calculated based on the sampling probabilities separately for each sampling stage for each study cluster. We calculated the selection probabilities for a cluster from the sample and the birth outcomes, and obtained the overall probability as the product of both of these probabilities; sampling weight was estimated by taking the reciprocal of this overall probability. The design weight was then adjusted for household non-response and individual non-response to obtain the final sampling weight. The quality related analysis is presented by ANC visits and by women. For the analysis by ANC visits, individual ANC visits with a maximum of first 4 ANC visits per woman that were captured in detail were utilised. The source of ANC services was categorised as the Village Health Nutrition Day (VHND),<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> public facility (all levels), and private provider (denoting all types of private service providers). We report on the distribution of ANC visits by the source of ANC services for ANC visits 1 to 4. The service coverage for&#x02013;weight measurement, blood pressure measurement, abdomen check-up, and urine and blood sample collection&#x02014;is presented for individual ANC visits 1 to 4 disaggregated by the source of ANC services. All of these components are considered essential components of every ANC visit as per the Indian ANC guidelines.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Therefore, a particular ANC visit was deemed of quality if a woman reported having received all of the above components of ANC services in that particular visit.

We found the Q-ANC coverage lagging considerably behind the ANC coverage without quality adjustment, and the disaggregated analysis has highlighted significant inequities in quality coverage between the ANC visits and by the source of ANC services. Importantly, with the widespread poor Q-ANC coverage in this population, sustainable delivery of quality services for pregnant woman through-out the pregnancy irrespective of the gestation period, the number of ANC visit, and the source of ANC services is urgently needed.</p><p id="p0160">The Q-ANC coverage was the least for ANC visits at the VHNDs. Four out of 10 ANC visits overall and 7 out of 10 among the 1st ANC visits were in VHNDs in this population, with the Q-ANC coverage being extremely low in these visits. VHNDs are designed to provide first-contact integrated primary health care and has the mandate to provide focussed ANC care, referral for women with signs of complications during pregnancy and those needing emergency care, and the requirement to have all the necessary supplies to provide all ANC service component.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> We found the VHND visits to predominately provide only weight and blood pressure check-up for pregnant women. Significant gaps in the VHNDs for other health services have also been reported.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> As many pregnant women utilise VHND for their first ANC visit, addressing the quality of ANC services at VNHDs would not only improve the mandate of VHND to identify complications and provide referral for pregnant women but also ensure that free good quality ANC services at VHNDs contribute towards improving equity in quality through the universal health coverage. The SDG target 3.8 aims at achieving universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> Therefore, equity analysis is vitally important to enable identifying who gets the worst quality of care to help guide policy decisions toward equitable distribution of health gains in the SDG era and beyond. On one hand, significant gaps in quality of ANC services by socio-economic status (SES) have been reported, and on the other equitable levels of poor quality are also documented.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Previous studies on inequities in ANC contacts have highlighted that those in the lowest SES experience both a limited coverage as well as poor quality of services.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This is also true in our population as women belonging to the lowest wealth index quartile reported the least number of ANC visits, had the highest utilisation of VHND for ANC visit 1, and received the least coverage of quality-adjusted ANC services. The pattern of Q-ANC coverage by the number of ANC visit offers an interesting insight that the relative advantage of a higher Q-ANC coverage for women in the highest wealth index quartile disappeared in the 3rd and 4th ANC visits. This pattern predominately resulted from the private provider ANC visits and higher proportion of 1st ANC visits in the VHNDs, and we found a reversal of this pattern for the public facility quality-adjusted ANC visits, with rich-poor gap in the opposite direction and in the 3rd and 4th ANC visits.</p><p id="p0165">The use of private providers was much higher than the public facilities for ANC services in this population. One needs to consider if this pattern were a result of the poor quality of ANC services in VHND as majority of the 1st ANC visits in this population were in VHNDs, thereby, reducing the confidence in the public health system among women for these services.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> However, of note is also that in the same population, we recently reported no evidence of decrease in the coverage of maternal services during Covid-19 peak period but documented a significant shift towards the private sector health facilities over this period, which could be due to the reluctance in using public sector facilities as many of these facilities were treating Covid-19 patients.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> This shift, possibly, countered the access-related issues for maternal services in this population, a phenomenon also documented elsewhere.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> We did find a lower Q-ANC for ANC visits with private provider during the Covid-19 peak period as compared with the non-peak period but no difference was seen between these two periods for public facility ANC visits.

First, we have relied on self-reported data, which are subject to recall bias. We believe this bias to be of less concern as women self-report accurately indicators related to concrete and observable actions performed on them (eg, blood pressure check, anaemia screening and urine test) as opposed to information or advice they were offered.<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref> Furthermore, the Q-ANC coverage for public facility ANC visits in this study corroborates well with another study based on exit survey of pregnant women in public facilities of the state (30.4%),<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> indicating low recall bias in our study. Second, the quality measures used are not comprehensive but are concrete and observable actions performed on women. These were captured as dichotomous indicators, where survey respondents answered yes or no, that does not necessarily measure quality comprehensively as it neither captures the appropriateness not timeliness of assessments and diagnostic tests offered during the ANC services. However, it is not possible to measure such nuances in a population-level survey. Considering these limitations, we may have over-estimated quality-adjusted coverage of ANC services. Lastly, we did not document whether the private provider for ANC services was informal or formal, which may need to be considered in planning private sector engagement to improve quality of ANC services.</p><p id="p0190">In conclusion, poor quality of ANC services is widespread in this population. The insights on inequity by wealth index by ANC visit and by woman offers a nuanced understanding that can facilitate addressing the rich-poor gap in access to quality services. Efforts to sustain the quality of services at each ANC visit irrespective of the source of ANC services through appropriate and effective tracking and monitoring of ANC services both at the health system and community levels are urgently needed to ensure that every pregnant woman receives quality services at every ANC visit.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0195">RD, GAK, and LD conceptualised the study.
