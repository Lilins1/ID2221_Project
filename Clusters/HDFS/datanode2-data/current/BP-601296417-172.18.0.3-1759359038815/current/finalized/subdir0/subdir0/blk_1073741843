Among them, the most widely accepted theory is abnormal embryogenesis in diamniotic monochorionic pregnancies, in which a malformed parasitic fetus is found within the body of a normally growing twin host <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

The patient's history was difficult to obtain due to the language barrier; however, his mother stated that she did not undergo prenatal follow-up during her pregnancy and that the abdominal mass had been present in the child since birth and had gradually grown. The patient had previously undergone assessments at another institution 4 years prior, including computed tomography (CT); however, we could not access the results or images. The patient did not undergo follow-ups due to limited access to medical care. Upon examination, a visible mass was observed on the right abdominal side, with mild tenderness on palpation. Routine laboratory findings were unremarkable. Initial abdominal radiography revealed well-defined, ovoid, and dysmorphic ossified structures overlying the hepatic shadow. Initial ultrasonography showed a large heterogeneous solid mass that was predominantly hyperechoic (fat) with a cystic component; further, a deformed hip joint was identified. Upon admission, previously obtained images were reviewed, and the patient was diagnosed with intrahepatic FIF. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT showed a large, well-defined, encapsulated intrahepatic mass measuring 16 &#x000d7; 12 &#x000d7; 14 cm in segments (IV and VIII); moreover, the cystic component was characterized by macroscopic fat, an axial skeleton, pelvis, deformed limbs, teeth, and an anencephalic calvarium. Additionally, minimal enhancement was noted, with no major arterial supply or venous drainage (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A CT scan showing a vertebral column and a skull base (red arrows) (A).

The mass was covered by a smooth capsule with bony components. First, the hepatic pedicle was identified, and the right hepatic pedicle was isolated. Complete liver mobilization and isolation of the right hepatic vein were achieved. The mass was dissected along its capsule, completely excised from the liver as 1 piece (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), and sent for imaging (<xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). There were no vascular pedicles or bleeding from the mass; additionally, the capsule was uninjured.<fig id="fig0002"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Gross photograph of the hepatic mass before the resection (left), and after the resection (right).</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0002">Fig 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2" id="celink0002"/></fig><fig id="fig0003"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>CT with 3D reformats showing an axial and perpendicular skeleton (A); further, a 3D specimen CT scan showing a vertebral column (red arrow), skull base (yellow arrow), scapula (black arrow), pelvis (blue arrow), ribs, and femur (green arrows) (B).</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0003">Fig 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3" id="celink0003"/></fig></p><p id="para0007">A mass measuring 18 &#x000d7; 15 &#x000d7; 14 cm with a smooth external surface was sent for pathological examination. Subsequently, obtained sections showed solid adipose tissue and large cystic areas containing mucoid materials. The upper segment of the mass contained hair- and tooth-like structures. The middle segment showed a possible vertebral column, cartilage, and gray-white solid areas. The lower segment contained limb-like bony structures with solid adipose tissue. Microscopic examination revealed a mixture of various well-formed organs, including the spinal cord and vertebral column (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A), skin and subcutaneous tissues (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B), prostate (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C), and testicular tissue (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D). The presence of these well-formed tissues was a diagnostic indicator of a fetus rather than a teratoma.<fig id="fig0004"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Histopathology showing a spinal cord and vertebral column (A), skin and subcutaneous tissues (B), prostate (C), and testicular tissue (D).</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0004">Fig 4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4" id="celink0004"/></fig></p><p id="para0008">Early in the morning of postoperative day 1, the patient became critically ill with hemodynamic instability, significantly elevated liver enzymes, and acidosis. Upon returning to the operating room, the patient showed a right lobe (segment VII) infarction and a completely viable left liver lobe. Accordingly, a right lobe resection was performed. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and died shortly after surgery due to multisystem failure.</p></sec><sec id="sec0003"><title>Discussion</title><p id="para0009">The pathogenesis of FIF remains unclear; however, 2 theories have been proposed, i.e., the diamniotic monochorionic twins and teratoma theories. Willis et al. initially proposed that the diagnosis of FIF should be restricted to cases involving parts of the axial skeleton <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The presence of a spinal column and axial skeleton indicates that the embryonic development passed the primitive streak stage, which is consistent with the monozygotic twin theory <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6]</xref>. Another study suggested diagnostic criteria for FIF, which are consistent with most commonly reported criteria of FIF, including (1) enclosed fetus within a distinct sac; (2) full or partial coverage of normal skin; (3) well-formed axial skeleton with a mature vertebral column; (4) grossly recognizable anatomical parts with systemic organization, including the upper and lower limbs, skin, prostate, and testicles; and (5) attachment to the host through a few relatively large blood vessels <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="para0010">The teratoma theory suggests that FIF is an extreme form of highly organized teratoma with well-differentiated and mature organs <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Teratomas have a relatively lower degree of tissue organization without systemic organization regardless of the maturity of the contained organs.</p><p id="para0011">Most cases of FIF are anencephalic, acardic, and have a vertebral column; however, 9%&#x02013;24% of cases of FIF lack a vertebral column <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Moreover, 55% and 36% of cases involve central nervous system and genitourinary tissues, respectively, with cases presented with other tissues like gastrointestinal, pulmonary, adrenal, and pancreatic tissues <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="para0012">In our case, all the criteria for FIF were met except for a large vascular supply and attachment to the host by a large vascular pedicle; however, Spencer suggested that only one or more features were required to consider FIF <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The presence of vascular pedicle has been suggested as a criterion since some cases of FIF are connected by both small and large vascular pedicles; contrastingly, teratomas are connected by multiple small vessels <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although some cases of FIF have presented blood vessel-like structures, only 1 report describe specific vasculature and an aorta-like structure on CT <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p id="para0013">Most cases of FIF are diagnosed during infancy. However, as observed in our case, limited access to medical care can contribute to delayed presentation. Generally, the most commonly reported symptoms of intra-abdominal FIF include abdominal distension with a palpable mass, vomiting, poor feeding, jaundice, and shortness of breath <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Specifically, the most frequent presentations of hepatic FIF, include palpable liver, failure to thrive, emesis, abdominal distention, and dyspnea <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5]</xref>. <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows a comparison of all reported cases of hepatic FIF. Another case of FIF was found in the anterior abdominal wall but not intrahepatic. Interestingly, its liver tissue remained fused to the patient's own liver parenchyma <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. All reported cases of FIF with a delayed diagnosis, as in our case, presented with progressive mass growth and a gradual increase in size. However, there was 1 case that showed a stable course without growth and was incidentally diagnosed in a 39-year-old patient <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Most cases of FIF have reported a single fetus in the mass, with only a few reports describing multiple fetuses <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0001"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of reported cases of hepatic FIF.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0005">Table 1:</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Our case</th><th valign="top">Magnus KG et al <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref></th><th valign="top">Al-Baghdadi R <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gender</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">Female</td><td valign="top">Male</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Age of the diagnosis</td><td valign="top">8 y old</td><td valign="top">5 d old</td><td valign="top">4 mo old</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Presentation</td><td valign="top">Growing abdominal mass with pain</td><td valign="top">Liver abnormality on prenatal US during the second trimester</td><td valign="top">Dyspnea, vomiting, and abdominal distention</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of fetuses in the liver</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Size of fetus</td><td valign="top">18 &#x000d7; 15 &#x000d7; 14 cm</td><td valign="top">Both are 3 cm</td><td valign="top">7 &#x000d7; 6 &#x000d7; 5 cm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Vertebral column presence</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Outcome</td><td valign="top">Death on day 3 after surgery due to liver infarction and multisystem failure</td><td valign="top">Good after surgery</td><td valign="top">Not reported</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="para0014">In conclusion, this is the third reported case of hepatic FIF. Although FIF is rare, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of growing abdominal masses in pediatric patients. Although an early diagnosis is usually established through routine antenatal imaging, many cases, including ours, are diagnosed late due to limited access to medical care. A multidisciplinary approach, including radiology, pediatric surgery, and pathology, is recommended for proper diagnosis and management. It is crucial to distinguish FIF from teratomas since teratomas have the potential to become malignant, and thus require close surveillance and monitoring of tumor markers. This case report supports the monozygotic twin theory of FIF and indicates that the diagnostic dilemma of FIF vs. teratoma can be solved through collaborative work between radiologists and pathologists since the suggested criteria have radiological and pathological aspects.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><title>Patient consent</title><p id="para0015">Consent for the publication of the patient medical information was obtained.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Matsubara</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Akasaka</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanagaki</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Okamoto</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A case report of fetus in fetu with an aorta-like structure visualized by contrast-enhanced CT</article-title><source>Rad Case Rep</source><volume>15</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>2645</fpage><lpage>2648</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.radcr.2020.10.006</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0002"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Basu</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jagdish</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Iyengar</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><name><surname>Bas</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fetus in fetu or differentiated teratomas?</article-title><source>Indian J Pathol Microbiol</source><volume>49</volume><year>2006</year><fpage>563</fpage><lpage>565</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17183856</pub-id>
