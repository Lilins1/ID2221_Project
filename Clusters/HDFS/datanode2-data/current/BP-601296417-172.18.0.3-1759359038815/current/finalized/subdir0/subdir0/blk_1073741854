Furthermore, oxygen is also a drug with benefits and adverse effects. We aimed to evaluate and compare the effect of real-time oxygen consumption versus fixed flow-based low flow anesthesia on oxygenation and perfusion and to compare the economic benefits. With ethical approvals and informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to a dynamic group (13 males, and 27 females) receiving fresh gas flows depending on real-time oxygen consumption (dynamic O<sub>2</sub>: N<sub>2</sub>O), and a fixed group (20 males, and 13 females) receiving fixed fresh gas flows of 600 mL/min (with O<sub>2</sub>: N<sub>2</sub>O of 1:1). Oxygen partial pressure and serum lactate were comparable between groups. However, isoflurane consumed and costs incurred were significantly different. Total oxygen consumption per minute was also significantly lower in the dynamic group than the fixed group. No episodes of hypoxia were observed in either group. Real-time oxygen consumption-based low flow anesthesia is feasible and cost-effective without affecting the patient&#x02019;s global perfusion and outcome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anesthesia economics</kwd><kwd>consumption</kwd><kwd>cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>fresh gas</kwd><kwd>gas concentration</kwd><kwd>inhalational anesthesia</kwd><kwd>partial pressure</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement><bold>Funding:</bold> The study was supported by All India Institute of Medical Sciences.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Oxygen is critical to human life, and because of its natural availability through the air, it is sometimes forgotten that it is a life-saving essential medicine. The timely availability of medical oxygen is a decider of patient&#x02019;s life and death. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taught us well. Patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia received a variable amount of oxygen during the perioperative period. Advances in anesthesia workstations and monitoring have made it possible to measure delivered inspired and expired oxygen concentrations. It has made low fresh gas flow (FGF) practical and objective, and many centers are adopting low flow anesthesia (LFA) and even minimal flow anesthesia due to its various advantages.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Although general anesthesia contributes very little to the greenhouse effect, growing environmental awareness, increasing safety regulations, and finally, cost considerations now require us to rethink clinical procedures related to anesthesia. Furthermore, the normobaric hyperoxia due to high supplemental oxygen is not without adverse effects. It has been associated with reduced cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, and potential tissue toxicity.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Metabolism of oxygen leads to the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species, which are counteracted in all cells by ubiquitous antioxidant enzymes and molecules.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, oxygen must be prescribed as a drug, and the dose should be titrated to a minimum effective dose for desired effects.</p><p>Despite the fact that medical air can be used with oxygen during general anesthesia, nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is still the predominant balanced gas.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Nevertheless, N<sub>2</sub>O allows a dose reduction of potent volatile anesthetics and opioids owing to intense analgesic activity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, there are concerns about hypoxia when used in LFA. Therefore, the need of the hour is the scope for further research for cost containment within N<sub>2</sub>O-based LFA without compromising patient safety.</p><p>Under general anesthesia, the oxygen requirement reduces and nearly corresponds to the basal metabolic needs.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, fresh O<sub>2</sub> supplementation can be based on basal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>). Although body mass-based basal VO<sub>2</sub> is described, it usually overestimates the VO<sub>2</sub> under general anesthesia. On the other hand, the oxygen consumed under general anesthesia via endotracheal intubation can be easily calculated from the differences between inspiratory and expiratory oxygen multiplied by minute ventilation. As the oxygen analyzer and anesthesia machine display all these data continuously, the VO<sub>2</sub> can be calculated in real time, i.e., per minute, or even per breath. While there is a description of metabolic flow anesthesia using pure oxygen, it involves quantitative anesthesia with closed systems and closed-loop technology. The exact matching of supply and demand has a meager safe margin for hypoxia and related pathophysiological responses such as increased pulmonary vascular resistance leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, coronary and cerebral ischemia, and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to tissue starvation. Therefore, a good balance between oxygen toxicity and hypoxia is required while maintaining the proven benefits of low and minimal flow anesthesia. We describe a technique of VO<sub>2</sub>-based LFA where the VO<sub>2</sub> was calculated from the real-time display of values, added a safe margin, avoided pure oxygen delivery, and without the need for closed-loop technology. The present study was designed as a pilot study to establish the safety of N<sub>2</sub>O-based lower FGF by determining the effect on oxygenation and perfusion where oxygen supplementation was based on VO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>S<sc>UBJECTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>The present prospective, randomized, single-blind, parallelgroup clinical study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur (No. 587/IEC-AIIMSR-PR/2019; on February 3, 2019) and written informed consent from each study participant.

The patient picked up any number from the available 20 random numbers in a block without any division or marking for concealment. The group allocation was based on the random number selected by each patient, which was kept on a separate sheet of paper in table and block format and was kept confidential from the participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Interventions</title><p>The induction of general anesthesia was standardized. All patients received isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare Corporation., Puerto Rico, USA) and N<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub>-based anesthesia. Nalbuphine injection (Neon Laboratories, Mumbai, India) 0.15 mg/kg was administered intravenously 3 minutes before the induction agent. All patients were pre-oxygenated till the fraction of expired oxygen (FeO<sub>2</sub>) was &#x0003e; 90%. Vecuronium (Neon Laboratories) 0.1 mg/kg was used as a muscle relaxant to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal intubation was attempted after 3 minutes of muscle relaxant bolus, and meanwhile, an FGF (100% O<sub>2</sub>) 2 L/min was maintained through a closed circuit. The tidal volume was kept at 6&#x02013;8 mL/kg of ideal body mass, and positive end-expiratory pressure was kept at 3&#x02013;5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (0.294&#x02013;0.49 kPa). The N<sub>2</sub>O dial concentration was kept at 60% with 1 L/min FGF from the intubation until an equilibrium coefficient of 0.8 for the isoflurane was achieved.</p><p>The dynamic group then received a VO<sub>2</sub>-based dynamic flow during maintenance, while the fixed group received a fixed low flow of 600 mL/min with O<sub>2</sub> : N<sub>2</sub>O of 1:1. Total O<sub>2</sub> flow in the dynamic group was equal to the calculated VO<sub>2</sub> plus 20 mL/min for safety. If the calculated O<sub>2</sub> flow required in the dynamic group came to &#x0003c; 200 mL/min, the O<sub>2</sub> flow was given as 200 mL/min (minimum possible and permitted flow in the anesthesia workstation). The Sykes formula was used to calculate VO<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> All flows were counted to the nearest 10 mL towards the upper side (the minimum possible on the workstation display). If the ventilator bellows were not filled up in the expired phase, the total flow was increased by 50 mL/min to fill it exactly in both groups (as required). However, the total O<sub>2</sub> flow remained as calculated in the dynamic group. In no case was the FeO<sub>2</sub> kept below 25% in both groups, and if required, the O<sub>2</sub> supplement (flow) was increased, and the time and reason were noted.</p><p>To adapt the study and increase patient safety, the maintenance of general anesthesia was administered at an age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.1, which was done by manipulating the isoflurane dial settings.</p><p>Before induction, a baseline arterial blood gas was obtained to know the baseline lactate level. Intraoperative arterial blood gas analysis was done at 1, 2, and 4 hours, depending on the duration of surgery. During the study period, any hypotension defined as mean blood pressure &#x0003c; 60 mmHg) was treated using indirect or direct vasopressors, fluid, etc., as needed in both groups per standard anesthesia practice to maintain 20% of baseline. Muscle relaxant was repeated on the train of four counts &#x0003c; 2. Injection of 0.05 mg/kg nalbuphine was repeated after 4 hours of surgery. All patients received an injection of paracetamol (Aculife Healthcare Private Limited, Ahmedabad, India) plus regional anesthesia-based multimodal analgesia.

The total oxygen supplemented afresh per minute was significantly low in the real-time oxygen consumption group. It can indirectly benefit the patients by averting the adverse effects of high oxygen concentration.</p><p>Oxygen consumption under anesthesia is dynamic and multifactorial; it depends on age, sex, height, weight, patient temperature, depth of anesthesia, and basal metabolic rate.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In our study, the patients were similar in terms of age, height, body mass, and temperature, including the temperature fall under anesthesia. The anesthesia depth during the study period was not different. Therefore, the reduction in isoflurane consumption, vehicle gas use, and cost was attributable to the intervention done in the study group. Interestingly, the O<sub>2</sub> required was lower in the intervention group even though the VO<sub>2</sub> was higher.</p><p>Further, there were no episodes of hypoxia or desaturation, and also no significant difference in SpO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub>. It indicates that N<sub>2</sub>O-based LFA using 600 mL/min total FGF has enough safe margin to accommodate O<sub>2</sub> at less than 50% inspired oxygen fraction. With modern anesthesia workstations and anesthetic gas monitoring, oxygen&#x02019;s real-time consumption by the patient under anesthesia can be calculated, enabling us to adjust the oxygen required to meet the patient&#x02019;s demand. However, frequent adjustments might be required. Some newer anesthesia workstations automatically calculate the oxygen consumption using inbuilt software and display it on screen. The user then can adjust the concentration of oxygen as required. We found that one can easily calculate the realtime oxygen consumption using the formula given by Oliver Sykes with any modern anesthesia workstation and adjust the oxygen concentration accordingly. Constant uptake of O<sub>2</sub> as compared to N<sub>2</sub>O leads to a significant fall in the actually inspired O<sub>2</sub> fraction. However, with constant monitoring of the inspired and expired concentration of anesthetics and vehicle gases, the possibility of delivering a hypoxic mixture is virtually nil. In the present study, FeO<sub>2</sub> was not allowed to drop below 25%, which is well above the average expired oxygen concentration in everyday life, i.e., 16%.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The other notable finding of our study was that real-time VO<sub>2</sub>-based LFA resulted in a lower FGF amount. It is a direct benefit in the context of environmental effects.</p><p>The literature search revealed no real-time oxygen consumption-based study to compare our results, but a few nearly related studies. Pedersen et al.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> studied isoflurane consumption for three different FGF in patients scheduled for major surgeries under GA with an expected duration of 2 hours or more. The study used an FGF of 0.6&#x02013;0.7 L/min after initial flows of 4.5 L/min.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The flow rates of Oxygen and N<sub>2</sub>O were adjusted throughout to maintain FiO<sub>2</sub> of 40%. They reported a decrease in isoflurane consumption by 57% with LFA with oxygen and N<sub>2</sub>O compared to medium flow (3 L/min) with N<sub>2</sub>O and oxygen. Our study found that real-time oxygen consumption-based FGF decreased Isoflurane consumption more than fixed gas flow even though the fixed gas flow group had also received LFA. Colak and Toprak<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> conducted a study to investigate if LFA can be used according to body mass because it is the primary determinant of oxygen requirement. They further inquired whether LFA and cost were feasible and safe in the normal oxygenation range. They concluded that 10 mL/kg FGF reduced the total costs by 38% compared with 20 mL/kg FGF.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, both studies have limited the FiO<sub>2</sub> to 40%. Our study found that FiO<sub>2</sub> can be reduced safely to 30% without any adverse effects with FGF based on real-time oxygen consumption. Ranjana and colleagues conducted the study to find the lowest FiO<sub>2</sub> levels achieved with a mixture of 300 mL/min each of O<sub>2</sub> and medical air and compared the overall analgesic requirement and cost while using similar flows of N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub>. The authors used initial high flows of 3 L/min followed by 300 mL/min of each gas (total 600 mL/min) in both groups. They reported that this technique is safe but associated with an increase in the cost of anesthesia and additional intra-operative analgesia in O<sub>2</sub> and the medical air group.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Further, the authors did not record the FiO<sub>2</sub> below 30%, similar to our study. LFA at an FGF of 10 mL/kg/min using a time-cycled ventilator with the setting of 3% sevoflurane, 50% oxygen, and N<sub>2</sub>O could be performed safely without risks such as hypoxia and severe delay of induction for patients weighing 53 &#x000b1; 5 kg for 5 hours.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The effect of LFA on hemodynamics and recovery, even in obese individuals undergoing laparoscopic surgery, has been reassuring and safer regarding the adequacy of tissue perfusion.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Even hypotensive anesthesia with a low flow was not detrimental to oxidative stress as measured using ischemia-modified albumin and thiol/disulfide homeostasis.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Our study shows that VO<sub>2</sub>-based FGF adjustment and N<sub>2</sub>O can be used safely until 4 hours in patients with a body mass index of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and FGF of 500 mL/min can also be achieved. Based on our observation and interpretations of the mentioned studies,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> we believe that our method can safely extend the real-time O<sub>2</sub> consumption-based anesthesia duration beyond 4 hours and even in obese patients.</p><p>A few challenges exist in applying the real-time VO<sub>2</sub>-based LFA and MFA; closed-loop technology availability and affordability for a wider population are major. Further, human resources training and familiarity with advanced engineering and technologies, their interaction, and interpretations will be paramount. Nevertheless, the standard practice for monitoring hypoxia by SpO<sub>2</sub> might need to be revised as SpO<sub>2</sub> detects hypoxia late. The oxygen reserve index might be an alternative, but it is again not widely available and affordable to mass.</p><p>On the limitation note, although we claim that our study was in real-time, we adjusted the O<sub>2</sub> every 15 minutes, which is relatively long. However, manual calculation and adjustment are nearly impractical during case management with limited human resources in clinical practice. Further, under anesthesia, if there is no change in depth and stress like pain or a sympathetic system surge, VO<sub>2</sub> variation is low. Nevertheless, these limitations can be overthrown easily using information technology. Developing software that automatically calculates the VO<sub>2</sub> consumption every minute gives feedback using a close loop circuit and automatically adjusts the FGF, and FiO<sub>2</sub> can be practical. We agree that metabolic flow and close-loop facilities and technology are available in advanced anesthesia machines. However, these machines are costly and largely inaccessible to most regions and practitioners in the world. Oxygen and anesthesia gas analyzers are mostly standard and available in lower-end machines. A simple software based on the oxygen consumption, as described above, can make this happen even in lower-end machines and make it affordable for the centers.</p><p>We conclude that real-time VO<sub>2</sub>-based FGF is safer and more cost-effective than fixed low FGF without compromising patient safety. Further research scope to use this technique for a longer duration and software development to calculate and deliver the desired FiO<sub>2</sub> in patients receiving general anesthesia is there.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Mrs. Shikha Shrivastava, Ex-Research Assistant of Dr. Habib Md Reazaul Karim, for her help in data management.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
