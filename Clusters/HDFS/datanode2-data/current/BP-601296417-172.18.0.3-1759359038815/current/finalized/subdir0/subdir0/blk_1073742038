This reflex was first described in detail by Wernoe in 1927 and refers to the stimulation of the nasal mucosa resulting in bilateral lacrimation.[ ] This pathway is considered to be an important part in both reflex tear and basal tear secretion, contributing about one-third of resting basal secretion through nasal respiration in addition to reflex bolus tearing.[ ] Hitherto, several clinical trials on TPP stimulation for dry eye have been conducted and have shown that the composition of all three layers (lipid layer, aqueous layer, and mucin layer) of the tear film is increased after stimulation, but the relevant meta-analysis has not yet been reported, which is the significance of this study."}
